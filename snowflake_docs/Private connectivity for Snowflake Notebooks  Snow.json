        "Set up private connectivity for your Snowflake account.",
        "Set up private connectivity for Snowsight.",
        "In addition, your account must already use Streamlit in Snowflake over AWS PrivateLink. Notebooks relies on the Streamlit engine for execution and uses Streamlit widgets to render cell outputs.",

        "To determine the hostname:",
        "Call SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG in your Snowflake account. The Notebooks hostname is displayed under the app-service-privatelink-url key, which is the wildcard URL required for routing Notebooks application traffic through AWS PrivateLink or Azure Private Link.",

        "You can set up a new VPC endpoint for Notebooks or create a DNS record to the same VPC endpoint of your Snowflake account, as shown in the following example:",
        "Record name: *.abcd.privatelink.snowflake.app",

        "Route traffic to: same VPC as your Snowflake traffic.",
        "Hostname routing at an account level is currently not supported.",
        "Notebooks apps serve both HTTPS-encrypted traffic and WebSocket-encrypted traffic. The Notebooks browser client application is mounted in a third-party, cross-origin\niframe within Snowsight. This enables strict cross-site browser isolation control.",
        "Snowflake Notebooks use a separate URL scheme for specific security requirements. Notebook URLs have their own top-level domain that does not share any elements\nwith Snowsight. Each notebook has a unique origin.",
        "Note",
        "When using AWS PrivateLink or Azure Private Link, you control the DNS resolution; no AWS PrivateLink or Azure Private Link DNS records are controlled by Snowflake.",
