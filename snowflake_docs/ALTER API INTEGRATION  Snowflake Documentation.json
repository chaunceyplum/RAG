        "Modifies the properties of an existing API integration.",
        "CREATE API INTEGRATION , DROP INTEGRATION ,\nSHOW INTEGRATIONS",
        "The identifier of the integration to alter. If the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire\nstring must be enclosed in double quotes. Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "Specifies one or more properties/parameters to set for API integration (separated by blank spaces, commas, or new lines):",
        "Specifies whether to initiate operation of the integration or suspend it.",
        "TRUE allows the integration to run.",
        "FALSE suspends the integration for maintenance. Any integration between Snowflake and a third-party service fails to work.",
        "The iam_role is the ARN (Amazon resource name) of a cloud platform role.",
        "This parameter applies only if the API_PROVIDER is set to aws_api_gateway.",
        "The \u201cApplication (client) id\u201d of the Azure AD (Active Directory) app for your remote service.",
        "This parameter applies only if the API_PROVIDER is set to azure_api_management.",
        "The API key (also called a \u201csubscription key\u201d).",
        "Explicitly limits external functions that use the integration to reference one or more HTTPS proxy\nservice endpoints (e.g. Amazon AWS API Gateway) and resources within those proxies. Supports a comma-separated\nlist of URLs, which are treated as prefixes (for details, see below).",
        "Each URL in API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES = (...) is treated as a prefix. For example, if you specify:",
        "https://xyz.amazonaws.com/production/",
        "that means all resources under",
        "https://xyz.amazonaws.com/production/",
        "are allowed. For example the following is allowed:",
        "https://xyz.amazonaws.com/production/ml1",
        "To maximize security, you should restrict allowed locations as narrowly as practical.",
        "Lists the endpoints and resources in the HTTPS proxy service that are not allowed to be called from Snowflake.",
        "The possible values for locations follow the same rules as for API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES above.",
        "API_BLOCKED_PREFIXES takes precedence over API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES. If a prefix matches both, then it is blocked.\nIn other words, Snowflake allows all values that match API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES except values that also\nmatch API_BLOCKED_PREFIXES.",
        "If a value is outside API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES, you do not need to explicitly block it.",
        "Specifies the tag name and the tag string value.",
        "The tag value is always a string, and the maximum number of characters for the tag value is 256.",
        "For information about specifying tags in a statement, see Tag quotas for objects and columns.",
        "COMMENT = 'string_literal'",
        "String (literal) that specifies a comment for the integration.",

        "Regarding metadata:",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
