        "Snowflake is pleased to announce the preview of the SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER function. This function splits a\nstring into smaller chunks of text, recursively, so that the text can be passed to embedding or search indexing\nfunctions. Since many language models have a limit on the number of tokens they can process, this function is essential\nto processing text larger than the token limit.",
