        "Returns the geohash for a GEOGRAPHY\nor GEOMETRY object. A geohash is a short base32 string that identifies a geodesic\nrectangle containing a location in the world.",
        "The number of characters in a geohash determines precision. Removing characters\nfrom the end of a geohash results in a geohash that is less precise and that identifies a\nlarger rectangular area.",
        "ST_GEOHASH returns a geohash that is 20 characters long.\nThe optional precision argument specifies the precision of the returned geohash.\nFor example, passing 5 for precision returns a shorter geohash (5 characters long) that is less precise.",
        "Note",
        "For a geospatial object that is not a point, the function might return a geohash of less precision, regardless of the default or\nspecified value for precision.",
        "In these cases, precision is determined by the bounding box of the geospatial object. ST_GEOHASH first determines the geohashes\nof the lower left and upper right corners of the bounding box and then returns the prefix that is common to these two geohashes.",

        "The argument must be an expression of type GEOGRAPHY.",

        "The number of characters to use in the geohash. You can specify a value from 1 to 20.",
        "By default, precision is 20, which produces a geohash that is 20 characters long.",
        "Returns the geohash (a value of type STRING) for the specified object.",
        "If the object is a Polygon and the two points of the bounding box do not share the same geohash prefix, the function might return\nan empty string.",

        "The following example returns a geohash for the same GEOGRAPHY point with less precision:",
        "The following example returns the geohash for a GEOMETRY point:",
        "The following example shows two geohashes that share the same prefix, which indicates that the two GEOGRAPHY points are near to each other.",
        "The following example returns the geohash for a polygon. The lower left and upper right corners of the bounding box of this polygon\nare the same two GEOGRAPHY points used in the previous examples. As shown in this example, ST_GEOHASH returns the prefix common to the\ngeohashes of the lower left and upper right corners of the bounding box.",
