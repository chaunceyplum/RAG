        "Returns a subset of rows sampled randomly from the specified table. The following sampling methods are supported:",
        "Sample a fraction of a table, with a specified probability for including a given row. The number of rows returned depends on the size of the table and the requested probability. A seed can be\nspecified to make the sampling deterministic.",
        "Sample a fixed, specified number of rows. The exact number of specified rows is returned unless the table contains fewer rows.",
        "SAMPLE and TABLESAMPLE are synonymous and can be used interchangeably.",
        "Where:",
        "Specifies the sampling method to use:",
        "BERNOULLI (or ROW): Includes each row with a probability of p/100.\nThis method is similar to flipping a weighted coin for each row.",
        "SYSTEM (or BLOCK): Includes each block of rows with a probability of p/100.\nThis method is similar to flipping a weighted coin for each block of rows. This method does not support fixed-size sampling.",
        "The sampling method is optional. If no method is specified, the default is BERNOULLI.",
        "Specifies whether to sample based on a fraction of the table or a fixed number of rows in the table, where:",
        "probability specifies the percentage probability to use for selecting the sample. Can be any decimal number\nbetween 0 (no rows selected) and 100 (all rows selected) inclusive.",
        "num specifies the number of rows (up to 1,000,000) to sample from the table. Can be any integer between\n0 (no rows selected) and 1000000 inclusive.",
        "In addition to using literals to specify probability or num ROWS, you can also use session or bind variables.",
        "Specifies a seed value to make the sampling deterministic. Can be any integer between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive.\nThis parameter only applies to SYSTEM and BLOCK sampling.",
        "In addition to using literals to specify seed, you can also use session or bind variables.",

        "BERNOULLI | ROW",
        "SYSTEM | BLOCK",
        "REPEATABLE | SEED",
        "The number of rows returned depends on the sampling method specified:",
        "For BERNOULLI | ROW sampling, the expected number of returned rows is (p/100)*n. For SYSTEM | BLOCK sampling,\nthe sample might be biased, in particular for small tables.",
        "Note",
        "For very large tables, the difference between the two methods should be negligible.",
        "Also, because sampling is a probabilistic process, the number of rows returned is not exactly equal to (p/100)*n rows, but it is close to this value.",
        "If no seed is specified, SAMPLE generates different results when the same query is repeated.",
        "If a table does not change, and the same seed and probability are specified, SAMPLE generates the same result. However, sampling on a copy of a table might not return the\nsame result as sampling on the original table, even if the same probability and seed are specified.",
        "If the table is larger than the requested number of rows, the number of requested rows is always returned.",
        "If the table is smaller than the requested number of rows, the entire table is returned.",
        "SYSTEM | BLOCK and SEED (seed) aren\u2019t supported for fixed-size sampling. For example, the following queries produce errors:",
        "Sampling with SEED (seed) is not supported on views or subqueries. For example, the following query produces an error:",
        "Sampling the result of a join is allowed, but only when all of the following are true:",
        "The sample is row-based (Bernoulli).",
        "The sampling does not use a seed.",
        "The sampling is done after the join has been fully processed. Therefore, sampling doesn\u2019t reduce the number of\nrows joined and doesn\u2019t reduce the cost of the join. The Examples section includes an example of\nsampling the result of a join.",
        "Both the LIMIT clause and the SAMPLE clause return a subset of rows from a table. When you use the\nLIMIT clause, Snowflake returns the specified number of rows in the fastest way possible. When you use the SAMPLE\nclause, Snowflake returns rows based on the sampling method specified in the clause.",
        "SYSTEM | BLOCK sampling is often faster than BERNOULLI | ROW sampling.",
        "Sampling without a seed is often faster than sampling with a seed.",
        "Fixed-size sampling might be slower than equivalent fraction-based sampling because fixed-size sampling prevents some query optimization.",
        "The following examples use the SAMPLE clause.",
        "Return a sample of a table in which each row has a 10% probability of being included in the sample:",
        "Return a sample of a table in which each row has a 20.3% probability of being included in the sample:",
        "Return an entire table, including all rows in the table:",
        "Return an empty sample:",
        "This example shows how to sample multiple tables in a join. It samples 25% of the rows in table1 and\n50% of the rows in table2:",
        "The SAMPLE clause applies to only one table, not all preceding tables or the entire expression prior to the\nSAMPLE clause. The following JOIN operation joins all rows of table1 to a sample of 50% of the rows in table2.\nIt doesn\u2019t sample 50% of the rows that result from joining all rows in both tables:",
        "To apply the SAMPLE clause to the result of a join, rather than to the individual tables in the join,\napply the join to an inline view that contains the result of the join. For example, perform\nthe join as a subquery, and then apply the SAMPLE to the result of the subquery. The example below samples\napproximately 1% of the rows returned by the join:",
        "Return a sample of a table in which each block of rows has a 3% probability of being included in the sample, and set the seed to 82:",
        "Return a sample of a table in which each block of rows has a 0.012% probability of being included in the sample, and set the seed to 99992:",
        "Note",
        "If either of these queries are run again without making any changes to the table, they return the same sample set.",
        "Return a fixed-size sample of 10 rows in which each row has a min(1, 10/n) probability of being included in the sample, where n is the number of rows in the table:",
