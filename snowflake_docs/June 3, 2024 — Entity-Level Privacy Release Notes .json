        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of entity-level privacy with aggregation policies. Aggregation\npolicies require queries to aggregate data into groups rather than return row-level results. Aggregation policies with entity-level privacy\nensures that each of those groups contains a minimum number of entities, where an entity is a logical object that needs to be protected\nsuch as people, organizations, and locations.",
