        "Warehouses are required for queries, as well as all DML operations, including loading data into tables. In addition to being defined by its\ntype as either Standard or Snowpark-optimized, a warehouse is defined by its size, as well as the other properties that can be set to help\ncontrol and automate warehouse activity.",
        "Warehouses can be started and stopped at any time. They can also be resized at any time, even while running, to accommodate the need for more\nor less compute resources, based on the type of operations being performed by the warehouse.",

        "For a multi-cluster warehouse, the number of credits billed is calculated based on the\nwarehouse size and the number of clusters that run within the time period.",
        "For example, if a 3X-Large multi-cluster warehouse runs 1 cluster for one full hour and then runs 2 clusters for the next full\nhour, the total number of credits billed would be 192 (i.e. 64 + 128).",
        "Multi-cluster warehouses are an Enterprise Edition feature.",
        "Increasing the size of a warehouse does not always improve data loading performance. Data loading performance is influenced more by\nthe number of files being loaded (and the size of each file) than the size of the warehouse.",
        "Tip",
        "Unless you are bulk loading a large number of files concurrently (i.e. hundreds or thousands of files), a smaller warehouse\n(Small, Medium, Large) is generally sufficient. Using a larger warehouse (X-Large, 2X-Large, etc.) will consume more credits and may not\nresult in any performance increase.",
        "For more data loading tips and guidelines, see Data loading considerations.",
        "The size of a warehouse can impact the amount of time required to execute queries submitted to the warehouse, particularly for larger, more\ncomplex queries. In general, query performance scales with warehouse size because larger warehouses have more compute resources available to\nprocess queries.",
        "If queries processed by a warehouse are running slowly, you can always resize the warehouse to provision more compute resources. The\nadditional resources do not impact any queries that are already running, but once they are fully provisioned they become available for use\nby any queries that are queued or newly submitted.",
        "Tip",
        "Larger is not necessarily faster for small, basic queries.",
        "For more warehouse tips and guidelines, see Warehouse considerations.",
        "A warehouse can be set to automatically resume or suspend, based on activity:",
        "By default, auto-suspend is enabled. Snowflake automatically suspends the warehouse if it is inactive for the specified period of time.",
        "By default, auto-resume is enabled. Snowflake automatically resumes the warehouse when any statement that requires a warehouse is submitted\nand the warehouse is the current warehouse for the session.",
        "These properties can be used to simplify and automate your monitoring and usage of warehouses to match your workload. Auto-suspend ensures\nthat you do not leave a warehouse running (and consuming credits) when there are no incoming queries. Similarly, auto-resume ensures that\nthe warehouse starts up again as soon as it is needed.",
        "Note",
        "Auto-suspend and auto-resume apply only to the entire warehouse and not to the individual clusters in the warehouse.\nFor a multi-cluster warehouse:",
        "Auto-suspend only occurs when the minimum number of clusters is running and there is no activity for the specified period of time. The\nminimum is typically 1 (cluster), but could be more than 1.",
        "Auto-resume only applies when the entire warehouse is suspended (i.e. no clusters are running).",
        "The number of queries that a warehouse can concurrently process is determined by the size and complexity of each query. As queries are\nsubmitted, the warehouse calculates and reserves the compute resources needed to process each query. If the warehouse does not have enough\nremaining resources to process a query, the query is queued, pending resources that become available as other running queries complete.",
        "Snowflake provides some object-level parameters that can be set to help control query processing and concurrency:",
        "STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS",
        "STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS",
        "Note",
        "If queries are queuing more than desired, another warehouse can be created and queries can be manually redirected to the new warehouse.\nIn addition, resizing a warehouse can enable limited scaling for query concurrency and queuing; however, warehouse resizing is primarily\nintended for improving query performance.",
        "To enable fully automated scaling for concurrency, Snowflake recommends multi-cluster warehouses,\nwhich provide essentially the same benefits as creating additional warehouses and redirecting queries, but without requiring manual\nintervention.",
        "Multi-cluster warehouses are an Enterprise Edition feature.",
        "When a session is initiated in Snowflake, the session does not, by default, have a warehouse associated with it. Until a session has a\nwarehouse associated with it, queries cannot be submitted within the session.",
        "To facilitate querying immediately after a session is initiated, Snowflake supports specifying a default warehouse for each individual user.\nThe default warehouse for a user is used as the warehouse for all sessions initiated by the user.",
        "A default warehouse can be specified when creating or modifying the user, either through the web interface or using\nCREATE USER/ALTER USER.",
        "In addition to default warehouses for users, any of the Snowflake clients (SnowSQL, JDBC driver, ODBC driver, Python connector, etc.) can\nhave a default warehouse:",
