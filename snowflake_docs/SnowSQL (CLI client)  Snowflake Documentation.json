        "Snowflake CLI is an open-source command-line tool explicitly designed for developer-centric workloads in addition to SQL operations. As an alternative to SnowSQL, Snowflake CLI lets you execute SQL commands as well as execute commands for other Snowflake products like Streamlit in Snowflake, Snowpark Container Services, and Snowflake Native App Framework. Snowflake recommends that you begin transitioning from SnowSQL to Snowflake CLI.",
