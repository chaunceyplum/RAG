        "You can extend the SQL you use in Snowflake by writing user-defined functions (UDFs) and stored procedures that you can call from SQL. When\nyou write a UDF or procedure, you write its logic in one of the supported handler languages, then create it using SQL.",
        "With a UDF, you calculate and return a value. With a stored procedure, you generally perform one or more operations by executing\nstatements in SQL or another supported language.",
        "You can also write an external function whose logic executes on a system external to Snowflake, such as a cloud provider.",
        "Choose between writing a stored procedure and writing a user-defined function.",
        "Read more about the guidelines that functions and procedures share, including guidelines related to deployment options, security practices,\nplatform constraints, and conventions.",
        "Use tools to package handler code and ensure that dependencies are available on Snowflake.",
        "Learn the benefits and supported languages.",
        "Learn the types of UDFs and supported languages.",
        "Record handler code activity by capturing log messages and trace events, storing the data in a database you can query later.",
        "Create secure access to specific network locations external to Snowflake, then use that access from within the handler code.",
        "Access custom code that runs outside of Snowflake, such as API services that provide geocoding and machine learning models.",
