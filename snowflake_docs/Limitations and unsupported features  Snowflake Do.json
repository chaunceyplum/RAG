Snowflake blocks loading code \u2014 including scripts, styles, fonts, and iframe embedding \u2014 from any external domain. However, loading a subset of resources from Mapbox is supported.",
        "When you use the st.map  or\nst.pydeck_chart\nStreamlit commands, Mapbox provides the map tiles when rendering map content.\nMapbox is a third-party application and is subject to Snowflake\u2019s\nExternal Offerings Terms.",
        "Loading images or media from external domains is supported in Streamlit in Snowflake, but not in the Snowflake Native App Framework.",
        "For example, the following code runs without a Python error, but the script is not loaded or executed in the browser:",
        "The CSP also blocks front-end calls that are generally considered unsafe, such as eval().",

        "To avoid this limit, design your Streamlit apps to retrieve data in increments smaller than 32 MB.",
