        "Currently, Snowsight does not recognize inherited privileges from database roles or application roles. As a result, even if a user\nhas the correct privileges through a database role, they might still be unable to perform certain actions, such as loading files into a\nstage, running a task, or monitoring a Dynamic Table in Snowsight.",
        "In addition, existing database roles are not displayed in Snowsight under Admin \u00bb Users & Roles \u00bb Roles.",
        "You can use the SHOW ROLES IN DATABASE command to ensure that you have correctly granted\nprivileges using the appropriate roles.",
