        "This function uses sequences to produce a unique set of increasing integers, but does not necessarily produce a gap-free sequence. When operating on a large quantity of data, gaps can\nappear in a sequence. If a fully ordered, gap-free sequence is required, consider using the ROW_NUMBER window function.",

        "If the optional sign argument is 0, the sequence continues at 0 after wrap-around. If the optional sign argument is 1, the sequence continues at the smallest representable number based\non the given integer width.",
