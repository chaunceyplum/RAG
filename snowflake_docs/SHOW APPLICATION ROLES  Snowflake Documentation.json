        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "Lists the application roles in the specified app for which for which you have access privileges.",
        "ALTER APPLICATION ROLE, CREATE APPLICATION ROLE, GRANT APPLICATION ROLE,\nREVOKE APPLICATION ROLE",
        "Specifies the app whose application roles you want to view.",
        "Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL\nwildcard characters (% and _).",
        "For example, the following patterns return the same results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",
        "The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "The string does not have to include the full object name; partial names are supported.",
        "Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output)",
        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'B' LIMIT ... FROM 'A' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'AB' would return results (if any rows match the input strings).",
        "The output of this command displays SNOWFLAKE in the owner column.",
        "The command does not require a running warehouse to execute.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",
        "To view all application roles in a specific app:",
        "To view up to ten application roles in the app named myapp after the first application role named app_role2:",
