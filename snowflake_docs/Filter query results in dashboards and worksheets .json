        "You can filter your query results in dashboards and SQL worksheets using system filters, available to all roles in Snowflake,\nor with custom filters created by administrators.",
        "Custom filters let you change the results of a query without directly editing the query.",
        "Filters are implemented as special keywords that resolve as a subquery or list of values, which are then used in the execution of a query.\nAs a result, there are some limitations when using a filter in a SQL query. See Specify a filter in a SQL query.",
        "Note",
        "Anyone in your account can view and use a custom filter after it is created. A custom filter has an associated role,\nbut that role does not limit filter visibility.",
        "To let a user create custom filters, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role must grant the relevant permissions to a role granted to that user.\nYou can only use Snowsight to grant roles the ability to create custom filters.",
        "To grant a role permission to create custom filters for your account, do the following:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",

        "In the Filters dialog that appears, select + Filter.",
        "To add a filter, complete the following:",
        "For Display Name, enter a name for the filter. This name appears on the filter when selecting the filter on a worksheet or dashboard.",
        "For SQL Keyword, enter a unique keyword to insert into queries. Use the format :<string>, without spaces.\nFor example: :page_path.",
        "For Description, enter a description of the filter.",
        "For Role, select a role to associate with the filter and run the query used to populate filter values, if the filter is based\non a query. Only roles with permissions to create custom filters appear in the drop-down list.\nSee Manage ownership of custom filters for more details.",
        "For Warehouse, select a warehouse to use to refresh filter values, if the filter is based on a query.\nThe owner role for the filter must have the USAGE privilege on the warehouse you select.\nIf you want to run and validate your query as part of these steps, the warehouse must be running.",
        "For Options via, choose whether the filter values are populated by a query or a list:",
        "If you select Query, select Write Query and see Write a query to populate a filter for guidance writing a\nfilter query.",

        "Select Edit List.",
        "Optionally, for Name, enter a name for the list item. The name appears in the drop-down list for the filter.\nIf you do not provide a name, the Value is used.",
        "For Value, enter the value of the column name to use in the filter.",
        "Continue adding name and value pairs until your list is complete, then select Save.",
        "In the Add Filter dialog, for Value Type, choose whether the list items are Text or Number types of data.",

        "If you want users to be able to see results for all items in the column, turn on the toggle for Include an \u201cAll\u201d option, then select\nhow you want the All option to function:",
        "Select Any value to have the All in the filter mean that the column to which the filter applies can have any value in\nthe results, whether or not the value exists in the filter list.",
        "Select Any value in list of options to have All in the filter mean that the column to which the filter applies contains\nany item in the filter list.",

        "Can return the optional column description.",
        "Can return other columns, but those do not appear in the drop-down filter list.",
        "A filter can only run one query at a time. You cannot run multiple queries to generate the list of filter options, for example by running\none query to return the name column and a second query to return the value column.",
        "Note",
        "The query used to populate a list of filter options is run as the user that created (or last modified) the filter.\nBecause anyone in your account can view and use a custom filter after it is created, make sure that the list of\nfilter options produced by your query do not contain protected or sensitive data.",
        "After you write your filter query and add it in the New filter dialog, do the following to finish setting up your query filter:",
        "Select Done to save your filter query and return to the Add Filter dialog.",

        "Each custom filter has an associated role. Anyone with that role can edit or delete the filter.\nUsers with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can view and edit every filter in the account.",
        "If the role associated with a filter is dropped, the role dropping the filter role does not inherit ownership of the custom filter. Instead, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can edit the filter and change the role associated with the filter.",
        "A custom filter that is populated by a SQL query also has a refresh frequency. The refresh frequency can be hourly, daily, or never.",
        "The filter runs based on when it was saved and how long it took to run the query that refreshes the filter options.",
        "For example, if you save a filter that has an hourly query refresh frequency at 10:07 AM, the first refresh query runs at or after 11:07 AM.\nIf a large number of filter refresh queries end up scheduled to run at the same time, the queries are queued to limit the number of\nfilter refresh queries running at the same time. The next filter refresh is based on when the last refresh completed. In this example, if\nthe query refresh at 11:07 AM takes 20 minutes to complete, the next refresh query would run at or after 12:27 PM.",
        "Filter refreshes run as the user that created or last modified the filter, and are visible in Query History as\none of the types of Queries executed by user tasks.\nSee Monitor query activity with Query History for details on using Query History.",
        "To determine which filter is responsible for a filter query refresh, you must open the list of filters and open each filter to\nview the details.",
        "Refreshes of the filter query can fail for one of the following reasons:",
        "The user that created or last modified the filter has been dropped or disabled in Snowflake.",
        "The user is inactive because they have not signed in for 3 months.",
        "It is not possible to see which users created or last modified a given filter. If you have filters that are failing to refresh,\nyou might see successful authentication attempts by the WORKSHEETS_APP_USER user followed by failed authentication\nattempts from a user in the LOGIN_HISTORY view view of the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema in the\nshared SNOWFLAKE database.",
        "For example, you can use the following query to identify login activity that uses an OAuth access token from the previous two days:",
        "Failed authentication attempts associated with a failed query refresh frequency would happen at the same time each day or each hour,\ndepending on the custom filter refresh frequency.",
        "You can use a system filter or a custom filter in a SQL query.\nYou cannot use a filter in a stored procedure or a user-defined function (UDF).",
        "To add a filter to your SQL query, use one of the following formats:",
        "Specify the filter as part of a SELECT statement, like SELECT :<filter_name>(<col_name>).",
        "Specify the filter using an equals sign as the comparator. For example:",
        "WHERE <col_name> = :<filter_name>",
        "WHERE <:filter_name> = <col_name>",
        "<value_a>:<value_b>::string = <:filter_name>",
        "You can only use an equals sign as the comparator for a filter, and as such, cannot use a filter with\nLIKE or CONTAINS.",
        "The column to which the filter applies must also match the value type expected by the filter:",
        "For a custom filter set to use a value type of text, the column must be a text string or cast to a text string in the query.\nSee Data types for text strings.",
        "For a custom filter set to use a value type of number, the column must be a numeric data type. See Numeric data types.",
        "For a system filter, the column must be a TIMESTAMP data type. See Date & time data types.",
        "When you add a filter to your SQL query and then use the drop-down list to choose a filter option, the SQL syntax of your query is\nchanged. For details about how the SQL syntax is changed when different options in the list are selected, refer to the following table:",

        "After you apply changes to a filter on a dashboard, the option to save your changes appears. When you select Save, the\nchanges you made to the dashboard are saved and available to other users of the dashboard.",
        "For example, you might select Apply to change a filter to see results from All Time, but you don\u2019t want the dashboard to run\nover such a large volume of data the next time someone opens the dashboard, so you do not select Save.\nAfter you run your dashboard over all time, you change the date range filter to Last 7 days, select Apply to run the dashboard,\nand then select Save to save that default filter value for dashboard users.",
        "The following system filters are available to all roles:",
        ":daterange",
        "Filters a column by a date range, such as Last day, Last 7 days, Last 28 days, Last 3 months,\nLast 6 months, Last 12 months, All time, or a custom date range.",
        "Note",
        "The date range filter always uses the UTC time zone and is not affected by the TIMESTAMP_INPUT_FORMAT parameter.",
        "Defaults to Last day.",
        ":datebucket",
        "Groups aggregate data by a period of time, such as Second, Minute, Hour, Day, Week,\nMonth, Quarter in calendar months, or Year.",
        "Defaults to Day.",
        "These filters cannot be edited or dropped.",
        "For example, given a table with order data, such as the ORDERS table in the SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA database and TPCH_SF1 schema, you\nmight want to query the table and group the results by a specific time bucket, such as by day or by week, and specify a specific date range\nfor which to retrieve results.",
        "To do so, you can write a query as follows:",

        "Sort the results from earliest to latest time period by including the  ORDER BY clause.",
        "When you add filters to your query, corresponding filter buttons appear at the top of your worksheet or dashboard:",
        "To manipulate the results that you see from your query, use the filters to select specific values.",
        "For this example, set the Group by filter, which corresponds to the date bucket filter, to group by Day. Set the other\nfilter, which corresponds to the date range filter, to All time.",
        "When you select Apply and apply the filter to your results, the results are grouped by day and results like the following output\nappear:",
