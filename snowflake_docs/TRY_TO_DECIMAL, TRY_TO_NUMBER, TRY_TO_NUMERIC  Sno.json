        "The function returns NUMBER(p,s), where p is the precision and\ns is the scale.",

        "The next example fails because the input string contains a dollar sign and\na comma to separate groups of digits, not just digits and decimal points. However,\nthe format specifier for the last column does not tell the TO_DECIMAL function\nto expect the dollar sign and comma.",
