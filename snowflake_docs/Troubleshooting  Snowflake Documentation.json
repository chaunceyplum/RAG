        "This topic provides guidelines for troubleshooting issues with the Snowflake Native SDK for Connectors. If you want to\ndiscover the cause of a specific error, you need appropriate tools\nthat make the troubleshooting process easier. For that reason the Snowflake Native SDK for Connectors provides a couple of\nprocedures, views, and other methods to troubleshoot the connector effectively.",
        "Usually when something wrong happens with the connector, or even when the user cannot\nexecute the particular procedure successfully because of the state of the Connector, the first source\nof the troubleshooting data should be the procedure response. In the Snowflake Native SDK for Connectors, the error response\nfrom the procedure is standardized. The response is returned as a VARIANT with\ntwo fields, that are always present:",
        "response_code - the value of this field, in case of an error response, is an error code, e.g. INVALID_CONNECTOR_STATUS",
        "message - the value of this field is a message that provides more information regarding the occurred error",
        "Structure of an error response:",
        "The Snowflake Native SDK for Connectors provides a couple of views and procedures that help in checking the actual state of the Connector.",
        "Views:",
        "PUBLIC.CONNECTOR_CONFIGURATION (See Connection configuration reference)",
        "PUBLIC.SYNC_STATUS (See Sync status reference)",
        "PUBLIC.CONNECTOR_STATS (See Connector stats reference)",
        "PUBLIC.AGGREGATED_CONNECTOR_STATS (See Connector stats reference)",
        "Procedures:",
        "PUBLIC.GET_CONNECTOR_STATUS() (See Core SQL reference)",
        "PUBLIC.GET_CONNECTION_CONFIGURATION() (See Connection configuration reference)",
        "By default, procedures provided by the SDK that are implemented in Java use\nConnectorErrorHelper to wrap thrown exceptions during the particular procedure execution. Apart from\nwrapping the thrown exception and mapping it to ConnectorResponse with an error\ncode, the default implementation of ConnectorErrorHelper logs events basing on the thrown\nexceptions to the Event Table if it\u2019s set up in the customer\u2019s account. If you\nwant to learn more about using Event Table, see the official Snowflake documentation.",
        "There is a possibility to filter out logs generated by the Snowflake Native SDK for Connectors from the event table\nknowing only the application instance name. In addition, there is also a possibility\nto filter out logs of errors that occurred in the most common parts of the Connector.",
        "Example query:",
        "Possible error codes:",
        "CONFIGURE_CONNECTOR_FAILED - occurs when Configure Connector Wizard step failed",
        "SET_CONNECTION_CONFIGURATION_FAILED - occurs when Set Connection Configuration Wizard step failed",
        "FINALIZE_CONNECTOR_CONFIGURATION_FAILED - occurs when Finalize Connector Configuration Wizard step failed",
