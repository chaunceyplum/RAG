        "After completing the troubleshooting steps using the Snowflake tools mentioned in Use Snowflake troubleshooting tools or the platform specific instructions mentioned in Follow alternative troubleshooting steps, you should perform the following steps based on whether the connection test succeeds or fails.",
        "Ensure the certificate issuer matches a trusted issuer, such as a cloud-based provider. A discrepancy might indicate an SSL inspection or an intermediary modifying the traffic, which Snowflake does not support.",
        "If the issuer does not match, contact your network team to address potential SSL inspection issues. Provide them with the output and request allowlisting of necessary URLs in the Snowflake allowlist.",
        "If connectivity tests fail, Snowflake recommends working with your network team and asking them to double-check your network settings, firewall rules, and proxy configurations. Verify that you have followed Snowflake\u2019s suggestions in the Common connectivity issues and resolutions section.",
        "If the troubleshooting steps or your system or network do not resolve the issue, and your system or network administrators verified the respective proxies and appliances are configured correctly, open a case with Snowflake support. Provide all relevant details and test outputs to facilitate a quick resolution. Collaborate with your networking team to ensure all necessary URLs and ports are accessible as per Snowflake\u2019s requirements.",
        "Please note that remediation of these issues in collaboration with Snowflake Support requires the engagement of teams responsible for managing the client network and network security, as Snowflake personnel does not have the authority to make changes outside its own managed networks.",
        "Snowflake Support might instruct you to collect the Snowflake driver and connector log files right after reproducing the issue and attach them to your Support ticket to Snowflake. You might also be instructed to collect the results of the browser test.",
