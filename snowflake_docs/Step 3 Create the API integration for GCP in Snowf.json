        "Replace <integration_name> with a unique integration name (e.g. my_api_integration_name. The name must follow the rules for\nObject identifiers.",
        "In addition, record the integration name in the API Integration Name field in your tracking worksheet. You will need the name when\nyou execute the CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION command later in the creation process.",
