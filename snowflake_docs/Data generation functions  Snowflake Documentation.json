        "Data Generation functions allow you to generate data. Snowflake supports two types of data generation functions:",
        "Random, which can be useful for testing purposes.",
        "These functions produce a random value each time. Each value is independent of the other values generated by other calls to the function.\nThe underlying algorithm produces pseudo-random values, and thus the values are not truly random or independent, but without knowing the\nalgorithm, the values are essentially unpredictable, usually evenly distributed (if the sample size is large), and pseudo-independent of\neach other.",
        "Controlled distribution, which can be useful for providing unique ID numbers for records that do not already have unique identifiers.",
        "These functions produce values that are not independent. For example, the NORMAL function returns values that have an\napproximately \u201cnormal\u201d (bell-shaped) distribution based on a specified mean and standard deviation. Thus, each new value generated is at\nleast indirectly influenced by previously generated values as the function tries to maintain the specified distribution. As another\nexample, the SEQ family of functions return a sequence of values.",
        "Note",
        "The UNIFORM function is listed as a controlled-distribution function, but is intended to generate evenly-distributed values.\nIn other words, it acts as though it\u2019s a \u201crandom\u201d function, but we refer to it as a controlled distribution function because the distribution\nis explicitly specified and because you can choose a data-generation function that produces non-uniform values over a large sample size.",
        "Function Name",
        "Notes",
        "Random",
        "Returns a pseudo-random 64-bit integer.",
        "Returns a random string of specified length.",
        "Returns a random RFC 4122-compliant UUID as a formatted string.",
        "Controlled Distribution",
        "Returns a normal-distributed floating point number, with specified mean and standard deviation.",
        "Returns a uniformly random number within the specified range.",
        "Returns a Zipf-distributed integer.",
        "Returns a sequence of monotonically increasing integers.",
        "Random distribution functions are deterministic.",
        "Each random distribution function takes a generator expression, gen, as its last argument. The generator expression, gen, can\nbe constant or variable:",
        "If constant, then the result of the random distribution function is constant (unless there are other, variable arguments, which is currently only supported for the\nRANDSTR function).",
        "If variable, then the result of the random distribution function is variable.",
        "Generator expressions must be a type 64-bit integer, although implicit conversions are allowed. Any expression that can be converted into a 64-bit integer can be used as a generator expression.",
        "The randomness of any random distribution function is directly linked to the randomness of its generator expression. For most practical purposes, the RANDOM data generation\nfunction is the best choice for randomly-generated integer values.",
        "Sequences generated by data generation functions are not guaranteed to be ordered and gap-free. This is because the numbers may be generated in parallel, in an unsynchronized fashion.",
