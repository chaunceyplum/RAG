        "Enterprise Edition Feature",
        "This feature requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact Snowflake Support.",
        "This topic provides an overview of how a warehouse owner or administrator can use the query acceleration service to improve the performance\nof queries running on a warehouse. For complete details about query acceleration, refer to Using the Query Acceleration Service.",
        "The query acceleration service offloads portions of query processing to\nserverless compute resources, which speeds up the processing of a query while reducing its demand\non the warehouse\u2019s compute resources.",
        "When a warehouse has outlier queries (i.e. queries that use more resources than a typical query), the query acceleration service might\nalso improve the performance of the warehouse\u2019s other queries because the extra computing demands of the outlier queries are offloaded\nto serverless compute resources.",
        "Examples of workloads that might benefit from the query acceleration service include ad hoc analytics, workloads with unpredictable data\nvolume per query, and queries with large scans and selective filters.",
        "Note",
        "You must have access to the shared SNOWFLAKE database to execute the diagnostic queries provided in this topic. By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role has the privileges needed to execute the queries.",
        "You can use a function or queries to determine whether enabling the query acceleration service might improve the performance of a query\nor set of queries.",
        "Function: Determine if a specific query might benefit",
        "The SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION function allows you to check whether a specific query is a good\ncandidate for query acceleration service.",
        "The function accepts a query id as its sole argument. Wrapping the function in the PARSE_JSON function makes it easier to interpret the\nresults. For example:",
        "If a query is a candidate for query acceleration service and has not yet been accelerated, the status of the response is eligible.\nA status of ineligible indicates the query will not benefit if you enable query acceleration service for a warehouse.",
        "For additional information about evaluating the query acceleration service for a particular query, including estimated execution times for\ndifferent scale factors, refer to the reference documentation.",
        "Query: Best query candidates across warehouses",
        "This query identifies the queries in the past week that might benefit most from the query acceleration service by calculating the amount of query execution\ntime that is eligible for acceleration.",
        "Query: Best warehouse candidates by execution time",
        "This query identifies the warehouses that might benefit the most from the query acceleration service in the past week. For each warehouse, it calculates\nthe total query execution time eligible for acceleration.",
        "Query: Best warehouse candidates by number of queries",
        "This query identifies the warehouses with the most queries, in the past week, eligible for the query acceleration service.",
        "The serverless compute resources leased by a warehouse for query acceleration consume credits independent of the credits consumed by the\nwarehouse, and are billed separately.",
        "Query acceleration service is enabled for an entire warehouse, but unlike upsizing a warehouse, it is only used for queries that benefit\nfrom increased compute power. This can be cost effective for warehouses that run a mixed workload because queries that do not require\nadditional compute resources do not incur the additional cost of using a larger warehouse.",
        "You can use the warehouse\u2019s scale factor to help control the cost of the query acceleration\nservice. This scale factor, which is a multiplier of the warehouse\u2019s credit consumption, sets a limit on how much serverless compute can\nbe used by a warehouse. For example, if a warehouse has a scale factor of 5, the credit consumption rate of serverless compute resources\ncannot exceed the consumption rate of the warehouse by more than 5 times.",
        "You can use the SYSTEM$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION function to gauge how the scale factor affects the\nperformance of a query.",
        "To maximize performance without considering cost, set the scale factor to 0.",
        "To enable the query acceleration service with a maximized performance boost, use the ALTER WAREHOUSE command as\nfollows:",
