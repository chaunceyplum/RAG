        "Streams and tasks in a database are not replicated unless you have enabled the stream and task replication preview.",
        "If you have not explicitly enabled stream and task replication, replication of a database with streams succeeds,\nbut the streams are ignored (that is to say, they are not replicated to the target account).",

        "If the database that contains the stream and the database that contains the base object referenced by the stream:",
        "Are separate databases or",

        "To avoid replication failures for databases containing streams:",
        "The replicated database must include both the stream and its base object or",
        "The database that contains the stream and the database that contains the base object referenced by the stream must be included in the same replication or failover group.",
