        "Tag propagation does not occur with versioned schemas in a Snowflake Native App and results in the following error message:",
        "To prevent the error message, the Snowflake Native App provider should update the setup script to ensure that tags are set on objects within the\nsame schema as the tag when a versioned schema contains either the tag or the object on which the tag is set. If a non-versioned schema\ncontains either the tag or the object on which the tag is set, it is not necessary to update the setup script.",
        "If you are a consumer of the Snowflake Native App and you see this error message after installing the app, ask the provider to update their set\nup script.",
