        "When you create a schedule for running your notebook, Snowsight creates a task to run your notebook on that schedule. Snowsight\nexecutes the notebook in a non-interactive mode, cell by cell from top to bottom. The task used to run the notebook is owned by the notebook\nowner role and uses the notebook warehouse to run. By default, task runs of the notebook auto-suspend after 10 failures. For more information about\ntasks, see Introduction to tasks.",
        "Each notebook run starts the notebook and connects it with the notebook warehouse. As a result, the warehouse used by the notebook is\nresumed and remains active until 15 minutes after the scheduled task is complete.",
        "Because the process of running a notebook on a schedule creates and executes a task, you must use a role that has the following privileges:",

        "In the notebook, select the schedule button, then Create schedule.",
        "The Schedule a notebook run dialog appears.",
        "For Schedule name, enter a name for the notebook schedule. This is used as the name of the task that runs the notebook.",
        "For Frequency, select a frequency at which to run the notebook (for example, Daily).",
        "Depending on the frequency that you select, adjust the Scheduled time and other options to match when you want the notebook to run.",
        "Optionally, for Parameter, you can add command-line syntax arguments to pass to the scheduled notebook. For example: key1=value1 key2=value2 --option2.",
        "Note",
        "If you pass -- (two dashes) as a standalone argument, then any argument passed before the dashes will be interpreted as passed to\nthe notebook runtime.",
        "Review the preview of the schedule, and select Create.",
        "A task is created that schedules your notebook to run.",
        "Once you create schedules for your notebook, you can view and make edits to the schedules via the\ntask list for the schema that the notebook is in.",

        "Locate and select the notebook to manage schedules for.",
        "In the notebook, select the schedule button, then View schedules.\nThis displays a table of all tasks contained in the schema that the notebook is in.",
        "Use the vertical ellipsis  menu on the task that runs your notebook and select an action.",
        "You can make edits such as changing the time or frequency of the schedule, and suspending or\ndropping the task completely. See Introduction to tasks for more details on managing tasks.",
        "You can pass command-line arguments to a scheduled notebook using syntax such as key1=value1 key2=value2 --option2. You can then access these parameters within the scheduled notebook using sys.argv inside the notebook.",
        "After your notebook runs as scheduled, you can review its run history:",

        "The Run History dialog for your notebook appears.",

        "To run a notebook using your own scheduling tool like Airflow, use the EXECUTE NOTEBOOK command. You can also pass command-line arguments to the scheduled notebook directly when running this command. For example:",
        "This executes the notebook cell by cell from top to bottom. The results are accessible in the notebook\u2019s run history section.",
        "The run history for your scheduled notebooks is limited to the last seven days.",
        "Changing the name of a notebook running as a scheduled task may cause an error in the task. You can manually\nedit the task using the CREATE TASK command to call the notebook with the changed name.",
        "If a scheduled notebook run results in an error, that run will appear in the run history with a Failed status. The user who created\nthe notebook can open the failed run and isolate the cell where the error occurred.",
