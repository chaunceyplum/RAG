        "The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard operations. It provides a programming alternative to\ndeveloping applications in Java or C/C++ using the Snowflake JDBC or ODBC drivers.",
        "The connector is a native, pure Python package that has no dependencies on JDBC or ODBC. It can be installed using pip on\nLinux, MacOS, and Windows platforms where Python is installed.",
        "The connector supports developing applications using the Python Database API v2 specification (PEP-249), including using the following standard API objects:",
