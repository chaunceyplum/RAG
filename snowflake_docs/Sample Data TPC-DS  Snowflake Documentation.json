        "As described in the TPC Benchmark\u2122 DS (TPC-DS) specification:",
        "\u201cTPC-DS models the decision support functions of a retail product supplier. The supporting schema contains vital business information,\nsuch as customer, order, and product data.",
        "In order to address the enormous range of query types and user behaviors encountered by a decision support\nsystem, TPC-DS utilizes a generalized query model. This model allows the benchmark to capture important\naspects of the interactive, iterative nature of on-line analytical processing (OLAP) queries, the longer-running\ncomplex queries of data mining and knowledge discovery, and the more planned behavior of well known report queries.\u201d",
        "Snowflake provides both 10 TB and 100 TB versions of TPC-DS, in schemas named TPCDS_SF10TCL and TPCDS_SF100TCL, respectively, within the SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA shared database.",
        "TPC-DS consists of 7 fact tables and 17 dimensions in the following schemas:",
        "TPCDS_SF100TCL: The 100 TB (scale factor 100,000) version represents 100 million customers and over 500,000 items stored, with sales data spanning 3 channels \u2014 stores, catalogs,\nand the web \u2014 covering a period of 5 years. The largest table, STORE_SALES, contains nearly 300 billion rows, and the fact tables contain over 560 billion rows in total.",
        "TPCDS_SF10TCL: The 10 TB (scale factor 10,000) version represents 65 million customers and over 400,000 items stored, with sales data spanning 3 channels \u2014 stores, catalogs, and\nthe web \u2014 covering a period of 5 years. The largest table, STORE_SALES, contains nearly 29 billion rows, and the fact tables contain over 56 billion rows in total.",
        "The relationships between facts and dimensions are represented through joins on surrogate keys. The detailed relationships are too numerous to display here, but can be found in the\nTPC-DS specification.",
        "TPC-DS contains a set of 99 queries with wide variation in complexity and range of data scanned. Each TPC-DS query asks a business question and includes the corresponding query to\nanswer the question. We have generated samples of all 99 TPC-DS queries for you to explore. Alternatively, you can use the tools in the TPC-DS Benchmark Kit to generate many different\nversions of these queries that vary by parameter values.",
        "For the 10 TB version, the full set of 99 TPC-DS queries should complete in under 45 minutes using a Snowflake 2X-Large warehouse.\nIf you use the 100 TB version, queries should complete in under 1 hour using a 4X-Large warehouse.",
        "Below, we describe just one of the queries. More information about TPC-DS and all the queries involved can be found in the official TPC-DS specification.",
        "This query looks at a year\u2019s worth of CATALOG_SALES table data and reveals the categories and brands where sales in a month vary more than 10% from average for a given call center.",
        "Find the item brands and categories for each call center and their monthly sales figures for a specified year, where the monthly sales figure deviated\nmore than 10% of the average monthly sales for the year, sorted by deviation and call center. Report the sales deviation from the previous and following months.",
        "The query lists the following totals:",
        "Extended price",
        "Discounted extended price",
        "Discounted extended price plus tax",
        "Average quantity",
        "Average extended price",
        "Average discount",
        "These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS and are listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and LINESTATUS. A count of the number of line items in each group is included:",
