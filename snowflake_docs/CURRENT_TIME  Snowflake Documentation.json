        "This optional argument indicates the precision with which to report the\ntime. For example, a value of 3 says to use 3 digits after the decimal\npoint (i.e. to specify the time with a precision of milliseconds).",
        "The default precision is 9 (nanoseconds).",
        "Valid values range from 0 - 9. However, most platforms do not support true\nnanosecond precision; the precision that you get might be less than the\nprecision you specify. In practice, precision is usually approximately\nmilliseconds (3 digits) at most.",

        "To comply with the ANSI standard, this function can be called without parentheses in SQL statements.",
        "However, if you are setting a Snowflake Scripting variable\nto an expression that calls the function (for example, my_var := <function_name>();), you must include the\nparentheses. For more information, see the usage notes for context functions.",
        "Do not use the returned value for precise time ordering between concurrent queries (processed by the same virtual\nwarehouse) because the queries might be serviced by different compute resources (in the warehouse).",
        "Set the time output format to HH24:MI:SS.FF, then return the current time with fractional seconds precision first set to 2, then 4, and then the default (9):",
