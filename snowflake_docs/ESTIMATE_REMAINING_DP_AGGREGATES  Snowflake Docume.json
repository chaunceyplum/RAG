        "Returns the estimated number of aggregation functions that can be run before the limit of a privacy budget is reached. The number of\nremaining aggregates is estimated. The actual number of aggregate functions allowed before reaching the privacy budget limit might vary in\npractice, depending on various factors.",
        "This function is useful for both implementing differential privacy and querying privacy-protected tables:",
        "Analysts can use this function to estimate roughly how much privacy budget they have left in a budget window.",
        "Privacy policy owners can use this function to\nfine-tune their privacy budget settings so the limit of a privacy budget is\nappropriate for every user.",
        "The privacy budget is calculated per aggregate function, not per query. So the query\nSELECT SUM(age), COUNT(age) FROM T GROUP BY STATE; incurs twice as much privacy loss as the query SELECT SUM(age) FROM T; (that is,\nthe query \u2018costs\u2019 twice as much). In general, all aggregate functions cost the same: the value of the MAX_BUDGET_PER_AGGREGATE\nparameter in the body of the privacy policy. Note that a GROUP BY clause is not considered an aggregation function, and does not incur\nprivacy loss.",
        "The function also returns the budget spent (that is, the current cumulative privacy loss), but Snowflake recommends using the function to\nfocus on the estimated remaining budget rather than the budget spent. The budget spent is not a linear function (number of aggregations *\ncost per aggregation), but rather a sub-linear function. This means that the total cost of additional aggregations decreases with use\nduring a budget window. This is why the estimated number of remaining aggregates is larger than the formula (remaining budget of privacy\nloss) / (privacy loss per function).",
        "The name of the table protected by a differential privacy policy. The function returns privacy budget data based on the queries that you\nhave run against this table since the last budget refresh.",

        "The refresh period of the privacy budget, that is, how often the cumulative privacy loss is reset to 0. Defined in the privacy\npolicy protecting the table.",

        "Estimates are based on the queries run by the user who is executing the function. A query is associated with a privacy budget based on\nseveral conditions, so be sure the environment you use to execute this function is exactly the same as the one used to execute the queries\n(for example, user, role, and account).",
        "If you\u2019re running a query that uses multiple tables, you should run ESTIMATE_REMAINING_DP_AGGREGATES once per table, then use the lowest\nNUMBER_OF_REMAINING_DP_AGGREGATES value as the estimated usage cap.",
        "Empty output indicates that the table is not protected by differential privacy (that is, does not have a privacy policy assigned to it).",
