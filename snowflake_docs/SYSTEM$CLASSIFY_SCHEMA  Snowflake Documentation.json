        "The name of the schema containing the tables to be classified. If a database and schema are not in use in the current session, the name\nmust be fully-qualified.",
        "The name must be specified exactly as it is stored in the database. If the name contains special characters, capitalization, or blank\nspaces, the name must be enclosed first in double-quotes and then in single quotes.",

        "Specifies each table that is scheduled for Data Classification.",
        "The specified schema name can contain up to 1000 table objects. If the schema contains more than 1000 table objects, Snowflake returns an\nerror message.",
        "Snowflake-provided stored procedures utilize caller\u2019s rights. For more details, see\nUnderstanding caller\u2019s rights and owner\u2019s rights stored procedures.",

        "When you call this stored procedure, the classification process for each table in the schema runs in parallel and consumes warehouse\nresources. If you call this stored procedure many times in a short period to classify tables in schemas simultaneously,\nthose processes also run in parallel. Many parallel classification processes can exceed the warehouse capability, which causes the\nclassification process for some tables to fail. Consequently, a schema might have some of its tables classified and others not classified.",
        "Prior to calling SYSTEM$CLASSIFY_SCHEMA, evaluate the number of columns in each table, the number of tables in a schema, the number of\nschemas that you want to classify, and the warehouse size that is in use for the session. For warehouse size recommendations, see\nCost of manually classifying sensitive data.",
