        "In a FROM clause, the LATERAL keyword allows an inline view to reference columns\nfrom a table expression that precedes that inline view.",
        "A lateral join behaves more like a correlated subquery than like most joins. A lateral join\nbehaves as if the server executed a loop similar to the following:",
        "Unlike the output of a non-lateral join, the output from a lateral join includes only the rows\ngenerated from the inline view. The rows on the left-hand side do not need to be joined to the right hand side\nbecause the rows on the left-hand side have already been taken into account by being passed into the inline view.",
        "This is a source of rows, such as:",
        "A table.",
        "A view.",
        "A subquery.",
        "A table function.",
        "The result of an earlier join.",
        "The inline_view can be:",
        "An inline view (a view defined within the statement, and valid only for the duration of the statement).",
        "A subquery.",
        "A table function (either a built-in table function such as FLATTEN or a user-defined table function (UDTF)).",
        "The inline_view cannot be a table.",
        "The inline view after the keyword LATERAL can reference columns only from the inline view itself and from\ntables to the left of the inline view in the FROM clause.",
        "Although the inline view typically references a column(s) from the left_hand_table_expression, it\nis not required to do so.",
        "Just as INNER JOIN syntax can use either the comma or the keywords INNER JOIN,\na lateral join can also use the comma or the keywords INNER JOIN.",
        "You cannot specify the ON, USING, or NATURAL JOIN clause in a lateral table function (other than a SQL UDTF), and you cannot\nspecify the ON, USING, or NATURAL JOIN clause in an outer lateral join to a table function (other than a SQL UDTF).",
        "For details, refer to the Usage Notes in the JOIN topic.",
        "This example uses the data shown below:",
        "This example shows a lateral join with a subquery.",
        "This example shows how a lateral join can use the inline view returned by FLATTEN:",
        "First, update the employee table to include ARRAY data that FLATTEN can operate on:",
        "Second, execute a query that uses FLATTEN and contains a reference to a column(s) in a table that precedes it:",
        "The following SQL statements are equivalent and produce the same output (the output is shown only once below). The\nfirst SQL statement below uses a comma before the keyword LATERAL while the second SQL statement uses the keywords\nINNER JOIN.",
