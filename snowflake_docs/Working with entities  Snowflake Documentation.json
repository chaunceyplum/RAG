        "The Snowflake Feature Store API is available in the Snowpark ML Python package (snowflake-ml-python) v1.5.0 and later.",
        "Entities organize feature views by subject matter so that users can more easily find the feature views they need.\nFor example, a feature store for a video streaming service might define entities for users and movies. Each feature view in the feature store\nis tagged as related to movies or to users, or to both, and you can retrieve a list of feature views related to these entities.",
        "In addition to helping to organize feature views, entities store the names of the key columns you can use to join the\nextracted features back to the original data.",
        "To create a new entity and register it in a feature store, use the feature store\u2019s register_entity method. Here,\nfs is the feature store instance (see Creating or connecting to a feature store).",
        "To see the registered entities in your feature store, use the feature store\u2019s list_entities method, which\nreturns a Snowpark DataFrame. (fs is the feature store instance; see Creating or connecting to a feature store.)",
        "You can retrieve a registered entity using the feature store\u2019s get_entity method; for example, to obtain its join keys.",
        "You can update an entity\u2019s description using the feature store\u2019s update_entity method:",
        "Other aspects of the entity, such as its join keys, are immutable. To change these, create a new entity.",
        "You can delete an entity using the feature store\u2019s delete_entity method.",
        "Entities that are referenced by any feature view cannot be deleted.",
        "Entities are implemented as tags and are subject to the limit of 10,000 tags per account\nand 50 unique tags per object.",
