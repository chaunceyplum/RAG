        "The fact that the function returns an integer number of months both when the days of the\nmonth are the same (e.g. February 28 and March 28) and when the days of the month are the last day of the month\n(e.g. February 28 and March 31) can lead to unintuitive behavior; specifically, increasing the first date\nin the pair does not always increase the output value.\nIn this example, as the first date increases from March 28th to March 30th and then to March 31st, the\ndifference increases from 1.0 to a larger number and then decreases back to 1.0.",
        "For the first column, the input dates represent the same day in different months, so\nthe function returns 0 for the fractional part of the result.",
        "For the second column, the input dates represent different days in different months (and are not both the last\nday of the month), so the function calculates the fractional part of the result.",
        "For the third column, the input dates represent the last days in each of two different months, so\nthe function again returns 0 for the fractional part of the result.",
