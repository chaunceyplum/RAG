        "Snowflake can push notifications to a cloud messaging service when it encounters errors while executing tasks, or when a task graph finishes successfully.\nThe notifications describe the errors encountered when a task executes SQL code, or identify the successfully completed task graphs.",
        "This topic provides instructions for configuring notification support for tasks using cloud messaging.",
        "The task notification feature is supported for both serverless tasks and user-managed tasks (that is, tasks that rely on a virtual warehouse\nto provide the compute resources).",

        "Notifications rely on cloud messaging using one of the following:",
        "Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)",
        "Microsoft Azure Event Grid",
        "Google Pub/Sub",
        "Currently, cross-cloud support is not available for push notifications.\nYou must configure notification support for the messaging service provided by the cloud platform where your Snowflake account is hosted.",
        "You can use the NOTIFICATION_HISTORY table function to query the history of notifications sent through Snowpipe. For more information, refer to NOTIFICATION_HISTORY.",
        "To set up task notifications, do the following:",
        "Create a topic to receive the notifications, and set up a notification integration for that topic.",

        "Note",
        "Snowflake Task integration is implemented using notification integration objects, which provide an interface between Snowflake and third-party cloud message queuing services.",
        "Snowflake guarantees at-least-once message delivery of notifications (that is, multiple attempts are made to deliver messages to ensure at least one attempt succeeds, which can result in duplicate messages).",
