        "A percent sign (%) matches any sequence of zero or more characters.",

        "There is no default escape character.",
        "If you use the backslash as an escape character, then you must escape the backslash in both the\nexpression and the ESCAPE clause. For example, the following command specifies that the escape character is\nthe backslash, and then uses that escape character to search for % as a literal (without the escape character,\nthe % would be treated as a wildcard):",
        "For examples of using escape characters, see the examples for ILIKE.\nFor more examples of using escape characters, and in particular the backslash as an escape character,\nsee the examples for LIKE.",
        "Only the upper, lower, and trim collation specifications are supported. Combinations with upper,\nlower, and trim are also supported (for example, upper-trim and lower-trim), except for locale\ncombinations (for example, en-upper).",
