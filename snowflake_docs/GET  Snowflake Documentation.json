        "Internal stage for a specified table.",
        "Internal stage for the current user.",
        "You can use this command to download data files after unloading data from a table onto a\nSnowflake stage using the COPY INTO <location> command.",

        "namespace is the database and/or schema in which the named internal stage or table resides. It is optional if a\ndatabase and schema are currently in use within the session; otherwise, it is required.",
        "path is an optional case-sensitive path for files in the cloud storage location (i.e. files have names that begin with a\ncommon string) that limits access to a set of files. Paths are alternatively called prefixes or folders by different cloud\nstorage services. If path is specified, but no file is explicitly named in the path, all data files in the path are\ndownloaded.",
        "Note",
        "If the stage name or path includes spaces or special characters, it must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g. '@\"my stage\"'\nfor a stage named \"my stage\").",
        "Specifies the local directory path on the client machine where the files are downloaded:",
        "You must include the initial forward slash in the path (e.g. file:///tmp/load).",
        "If the directory path includes special characters, the entire file URI must be enclosed in single quotes.",
        "You must include the drive and backslash in the path (e.g. file://C:tempload).",
        "If the directory path includes special characters, the entire file URI must be enclosed in single quotes. Note that\nthe drive and path separator is a forward slash (/) in enclosed URIs (e.g. 'file://C:/temp/load data' for a path in\nWindows that includes a directory named load data).",
        "Note",
        "The GET command returns an error if you specify a filename as part of the path, except if you use the\nJDBC driver or ODBC driver. If you specify a filename when\nusing either driver, the driver treats the filename as part of the directory path and creates a subdirectory with the specified\nfilename.",
        "For example, if you specify file:///tmp/load/file.csv, the JDBC or ODBC driver creates a subdirectory named file.csv/\nunder the path /tmp/load/. The GET command then downloads the staged files into this new subdirectory.",
        "Specifies the number of threads to use for downloading the files. The granularity unit for downloading is one file.",
        "Increasing the number of threads can improve performance when downloading large files.",
        "Supported values: Any integer value from 1 (no parallelism) to 99 (use 99 threads for downloading files).",
        "Default: 10",
        "Specifies a regular expression pattern for filtering files to download. The command lists all files in the specified path\nand applies the regular expression pattern on each of the files found.",
        "Default: No value (all files in the specified stage are downloaded)",
        "GET does not support the following actions:",
        "Downloading files from external stages. To download files from external stages, use the utilities\nprovided by your cloud service.",
        "Downloading multiple files with divergent directory paths. The command\ndoes not preserve stage directory structure when transferring files to your client machine.",
        "For example, the following GET statement returns an error since you can\u2019t download multiple files named tmp.parquet that are in\ndifferent subdirectories on the stage.",
        "The ODBC driver supports GET with Snowflake accounts hosted on the following platforms:",
        "Amazon Web Services (using ODBC Driver Version 2.17.5 and higher).",
        "Google Cloud (using ODBC Driver Version 2.21.5 and higher).",
        "Microsoft Azure (using ODBC Driver Version 2.20.2 and higher).",
        "The command cannot be executed from the Worksheets  page in either Snowflake web interface; instead, use the\nSnowSQL client to download data files, or check the documentation for the specific Snowflake client to verify support for this command.",
        "The command does not rename files.",
        "Downloaded files are automatically decrypted using the same key that was used to encrypt the file when it was either uploaded\n(using PUT) or unloaded from a table (using COPY INTO <location>).",
        "For the PUT and GET commands,\nan EXECUTION_STATUS of success in the QUERY_HISTORY\ndoes not mean that data files were successfully uploaded or downloaded.\nInstead, the status indicates that Snowflake received authorization to proceed with the file transfer.",
