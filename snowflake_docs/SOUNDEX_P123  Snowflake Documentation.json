        "Returns a string that contains a phonetic representation of the input string, and retains the Soundex code number for the second\nletter when the first and second letters use the same number.",
        "This function is similar to the SOUNDEX function except for cases in which the first and second letters of the input string\nuse the same Soundex code number. In those cases, the SOUNDEX function ignores the number for the second letter, while the\nSOUNDEX_P123 function preserves the number for the second letter. This variant of the Soundex algorithm is used by some database\nsystems (e.g. Teradata).",
