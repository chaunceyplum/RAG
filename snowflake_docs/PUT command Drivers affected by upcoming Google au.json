        "This behavior change is in the 2023_07 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "Due to enforced PUT command authentication changes by Google, driver applications behave as follows:",
        "Customers  with their Snowflake accounts hosted on Google Cloud using driver versions lower than the updated minimum versions listed below can still use older Google\nauthentication methods for PUT requests.",
        "Once the bundle is enabled, Snowflake will no longer allow applications to use this older Google authentication method, in preparation for the changes that will be enforced by Google in January 2024. For any applications based on older driver versions, Snowflake will automatically throw the following exception for any PUT command:",
        "To continue using your driver applications without disruption, you must upgrade your drivers to at least the new minimum versions below. Snowflake recommends that you upgrade to the latest versions listed in the Client Versions & Support Policy topic by October 30, 2023 when this behavior bundle will be enabled by default.",
        "Caution",
        "Beginning on January 15, 2024, Google will enforce the new PUT authentication method without exception. Consequently, Snowflake will NOT be able to allow customers to opt out of this behavior change after this date.",
        "Please note that newer versions also introduce new PUT overwrite behavior that might require you to update code or scripts that use the PUT command. For more information, see the BCR 2023_06 PUT overwrite documentation topic.",
        "Note",
        "For more background on this issue, please see this help article. Affected customers have also received previous emails regarding this issue with the subject line \u201cImportant! Action Required: Upgrade Client Drivers for your Snowflake accounts on Google Cloud\u201d.",
