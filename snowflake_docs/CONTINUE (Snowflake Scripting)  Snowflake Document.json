        "CONTINUE and ITERATE are synonymous.",
        "If the loop is embedded in another loop(s), you can break out of not only the current loop and start from the first statement in\nthe enclosing loop by including the enclosing loop\u2019s label as part of the CONTINUE. For an example, see the examples\nsection below.",
        "The following loop iterates 3 times. Because the code after the CONTINUE statement is not executed, the variable\nnamed counter2 will be 0 rather than 3.",
