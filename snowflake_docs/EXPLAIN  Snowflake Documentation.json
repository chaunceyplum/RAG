        "Use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be\nqueried.",
        "Generate the output in JSON format and insert the JSON-formatted output into a table for analysis later.\nIf you store the output in JSON format, you can use the function SYSTEM$EXPLAIN_JSON_TO_TEXT or\nEXPLAIN_JSON to convert the JSON to a more human readable format (either tabular or formatted text).",
        "The assignedPartitions and assignedBytes values are upper bound estimates for query execution. Runtime optimizations\nsuch as join pruning can reduce the number of partitions and bytes scanned during query execution.",
        "The EXPLAIN plan is the \u201clogical\u201d explain plan. It shows the operations that will be performed, and their\nlogical relationship to each other. The actual execution order of the operations in the plan does not necessarily\nmatch the logical order shown by the plan.",
