        "Important",
        "Performance improvements often target specific query patterns or workloads. These improvements might or might not have a material impact\non a specific workload.",

        "Reduces compilation times by skipping optimizations that will not result in performance improvements.",
        "August 2023",
        "Ability to use a query hash to identify patterns and trends in query execution.",
        "Helps to monitor and analyze recurring queries by including a query hash of each query in\nACCOUNT_USAGE views and INFORMATION_SCHEMA table functions. Can be used to determine the effects of performance improvements like\nchoosing a new cluster key.",
        "August 2023",
        "Improved execution times for non-clustered tables.",
        "Reduces execution time for SELECT and DML operations against non-clustered tables with micro-partitions that are smaller than\naverage.",
        "August 2023",
        "Ability to call the GET_QUERY_OPERATOR_STATS function to obtain query profile statistics.\n(General Availability)",
        "Helps to programmatically debug queries and gain insights into query performance.",
        "August 2023",
        "Improved execution times for joins on wide build-side rows.",
        "Reduces execution time and improves memory management for queries matching wide rows on the build side of a join (for example,\nrows that include columns with long strings).",
        "July 2023",
        "Improved compile times for materialized views.",
        "Reduces compilation times for materialized views based on tables that have 100s or 1000s of micro-partitions.",

        "Search Optimization Update: Support for\nsubstring search in VARIANT types. (Preview)",
        "Improves the performance of point lookup queries that use substring and regular expression functions against semi-structured data,\nincluding ARRAY, OBJECT, and VARIANT types.",
        "July 2023",
        "Improved compile times for simple queries and DML statements.",
        "Reduces compilation times and improves memory management for simple DML statements and single-table queries with simple equality\nor range predicates.",
        "June 2023",
        "Improved execution times for SELECT statements with LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses.",
        "Reduces execution time of some queries with long-running SELECT statements containing both LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses.",
