        "Cosine similarity is based on the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space; the magnitude of the vectors is not\nconsidered. The cosine similarity value is the inner product of the vectors divided by the product of their lengths. The cosine\nsimilarity is always in the interval [-1, 1]. For example, identical vectors have a cosine similarity of 1, two\northogonal vectors have a similarity of 0, and two opposite vectors have a similarity of -1.",
