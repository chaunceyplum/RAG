        "Individual users can use this command to alter specific properties and any session parameter defaults for themselves. For more details, see\nUsage Notes (in this topic).",
        "Can also be used to abort all queries (and other SQL statements) submitted by the user.",

        "Specifies the identifier for the user to alter. If the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire string must be enclosed in\ndouble quotes. Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "If the identifier is omitted, the statement modifies the active (i.e. logged in) user. The restrictions described in Usage Notes (in\nthis topic) apply.",

        "For more details, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Generates a URL, which you can share with the user, that opens a web page from which the user can enter a new password. The generated URL is\nvalid for a single use and expires after 4 hours.",
        "Note that specifying this parameter does not invalidate the user\u2019s current password. The user can continue to use their current password\nuntil they reset it through the URL.",
        "If you wish to invalidate their current password, use SET PASSWORD = 'string' instead, which changes their password to a new value.",
        "Aborts all the queries and other SQL statements currently running or scheduled by the user, regardless of the warehouse on which the queries\nare running/scheduled.",
        "Note that the user can still log into Snowflake and initiate new queries.",

        "To enable or disable multi-factor authentication, modify the user\u2019s DISABLE_MFA property. When\nan account administrator executes the ALTER USER command to set DISABLE_MFA to TRUE, the value for the\nEXT_AUTHN_DUO property is automatically set to FALSE.",
        "Refer to Usage Notes (in this topic) for more general details about setting and unsetting properties.",
        "Specifies one (or more) parameters to set for the user (separated by blank spaces, commas, or new\nlines):",
        "Controls how queries that fail due to syntax or parsing errors show up in a query history. If FALSE, the contents of a\nfailed query is redacted from the views, pages, and functions that provide a query history.",
        "This parameter controls behavior for the user viewing the query history, not the user who executed the query.",
        "Only users with a role that is granted or inherits the AUDIT privilege can set the ENABLE_UNREDACTED_QUERY_SYNTAX_ERROR parameter.",
        "Specifies the network policy that is active for the user.",
        "Also, see Usage Notes (in this topic) for more general details about setting and unsetting parameters.",

        "Alternatively, use RESET PASSWORD to generate a URL to a web page that the user can access to change their password.",

        "An ALTER USER statement does not verify that default objects (DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE, DEFAULT_NAMESPACE,\nand DEFAULT_ROLE) exist. Note that DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES does not accept an object name as the value, but an ALTER\nUSER statement does verify that a supported value is specified.",

        "When setting multiple properties/parameters, separate them with blank spaces, commas, or new lines.",
        "When unsetting multiple properties/parameters, they must be separated by a comma. Also, when unsetting a property/parameter,\nspecify only the name; specifying a value for the property/parameter will return an error.",
        "If you specify SET DISABLED = TRUE for a user:",
        "All queries and other SQL statements currently running or scheduled by the user are aborted and the user cannot initiate additional queries.",
