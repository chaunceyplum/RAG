        "How do I preview data while writing SQL?",
        "How do I see query details from my worksheet?",
        "Where is my account info?",
        "Snowsight doesn\u2019t automatically copy the worksheets you had open in Classic Console.",
        "If you don\u2019t see the queries and worksheets that you were running in Classic Console,\nimport your worksheets.",
        "Note",
        "Worksheets are not continually synced from Classic Console and Snowsight. If you create or make updates to a SQL worksheet\nin Snowsight, the changes are not reflected in Classic Console, and vice versa.",
        "If you already imported your worksheets but you can\u2019t find them, look for a folder named Import YYYY-MM-DD, where the date matches\nthe date that you imported your worksheets.",
        "To recreate the worksheet tabs you had open in Classic Console:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "To return to Classic Console, in the navigation menu, select your user menu, and then select Classic Console.",
        "Note the titles of your open worksheets.",
        "Return to Snowsight.",
        "Locate the worksheets that you had open and reopen them as tabs in Snowsight.",
        "In Snowsight, you can load data from a local file or a file on a stage into an existing or new table.",
        "While in a worksheet, you can use the object explorer to load data into an existing table.",
        "You can also navigate to a database schema and create a table from a file.",
        "See Load data using the web interface for full details.",
        "If you want to preview the contents of a data table while writing SQL or Snowpark Python in a worksheet, you can use the object explorer:",
        "From a worksheet, select Databases in the object explorer. If you don\u2019t see the object explorer, select Open sidebar.",
        "Locate the database and schema that contain the table you want to preview, and then select the table.",
        "In the table details section that appears, select  (Preview table).",
        "A data preview opens overlaying your worksheet, displaying a sample of data in the table.",
        "You can also preview the column names and comments of a database table without previewing the data. See Refer to database object names in worksheets.",
        "After you run a SQL query, when you view the Results, you can select the Query Details to see information about your query,\nsuch as the bytes scanned and the end time.",
        "To review the queries that have been run in the worksheet, as well as the results for those queries, select \n(Query history).",
        "For more details, see View query history. If you open the query details, you open the query profile for the\nquery. See Review Query Profile.",
        "To retrieve your account information, such as to copy the account identifier to sign in to SnowSQL, the Snowflake VS Code Extension, or\nanother connection to Snowflake, you can use the account menu in Snowsight:",
        "Open the account selector and review the list of accounts that you previously signed in to.",
        "Locate the account for which you want to copy the account name.",
        "Hover over the account to view additional details, and then select the copy icon to copy the account identifier in the format\norgname.account_name to your clipboard.",
        "Note",
        "The account identifier is copied in the format orgname.account_name, which is used for SQL commands and operations.",
        "If you need to use the account identifier with a Snowflake driver (for example, JDBC or ODBC), you need to replace the period (.) with\na hyphen (-) so the identifier is formatted as orgname-account_name.",
        "You can also copy the account URL and review additional details, such as the name of your Snowflake organization, the edition of your\naccount, and your Snowflake region.",
        "You can import your SQL worksheets from the Classic Console to Snowsight from within Snowsight.",
        "Import your SQL worksheets to make it easier to refer to queries and SQL statements that you\u2019ve written in the past,\nwithout needing to switch to a different web interface and session.",
        "Note",
        "You can import your worksheets to Snowsight even if you can no longer access the Classic Console.",
        "To import your SQL worksheets to Snowsight, do the following:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "Select Projects \u00bb Worksheets.",
        "Select the \u2026 more menu \u00bb Import Worksheets.",
        "In the confirmation dialog, select Import.",
        "Snowflake creates a folder named Import YYYY-MM-DD and places all worksheets from the Classic Console in that folder.",
        "Important",
        "Snowsight has a maximum worksheet size of 1MB. Worksheets larger than 1MB fail to import.\nSee Troubleshoot issues with upgrading to Snowsight.",
        "Worksheets are not synced between Snowsight and the Classic Console.\nIf you make updates to a SQL worksheet in Snowsight, the changes are not reflected in the Classic Console, and vice versa.",
