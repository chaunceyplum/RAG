        "The name must be specified exactly as it is stored in the database. If the name contains special characters, capitalization, or blank\nspaces, the name must be enclosed first in double-quotes and then in single quotes.",

        "Specifies the privacy category tag value.",
        "The possible values are IDENTIFIER, QUASI-IDENTIFIER and SENSITIVE.",
        "Specifies one of the following values: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW. This value indicates the relative confidence that Snowflake has based upon the column sampling process and how the column data aligns with how Snowflake classifies data.",
