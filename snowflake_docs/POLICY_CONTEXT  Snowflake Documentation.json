        "Simulates the results of a query based upon the value of one or more context functions, which lets you determine how policies affect query\nresults.  Context functions return a value based on the current context of a query, for example, who is executing the query or the account\nfrom which the query is being executed. Policy bodies often use context functions to determine which value to return from the policy.",
