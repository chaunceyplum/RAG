        "This topic describes how to create an APPLICATION object from an application package.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework allows provider to create an APPLICATION object within the same account as the\napplication package. This allows providers to test a Snowflake Native App before publishing it to consumers.\nIt also allows providers to test the Snowflake Native App in a single account without having to\nalternate between provider and consumer accounts.",
        "To create an APPLICATION object from an application package you must have the following privileges\ngranted to your role:",
        "The CREATE APPLICATION account-level privilege granted to your role.",
        "The INSTALL object-level privilege granted on the application package.",
        "The following examples show how to use the GRANT <privileges> command\nto grant these privileges to your account:",
        "By default, the role used to create an application package has permissions to run the\nCREATE APPLICATION command to create an APPLICATION object based on the\napplication package.",
        "However, in some development environments you may need to allow users with other roles to\ncreate and test an application package. To do this, grant the DEVELOP object-level privilege\non the application package to a role.",
        "The DEVELOP account-level privilege provides the necessary privileges to create and test an\nAPPLICATION object based on an application package. The DEVELOP privilege enables a user to perform\nthe following tasks using the application package on which they have been granted access:",
        "Create a version of an APPLICATION object based on a version or patch level specified in the\napplication package.",
        "Upgrade a version of an application package using the ALTER APPLICATION\ncommand.",
        "Create and upgrade an APPLICATION object using files on a named stage.",
        "Enable debug mode on an APPLICATION object created in development mode.",
        "To grant the DEVELOP privilege to a specific role, use the GRANT <privileges>\ncommand as shown in the following example:",
        "Note",
        "The DEVELOP object-level privilege is specific to a single application package. You must run\nGRANT <privileges> for each application on which you want\nto assign the DEVELOP privilege.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework provides different ways of creating an APPLICATION object from an application\npackage. This allows you to test a Snowflake Native App before publishing it to consumers. The method you\nuse depends on what parts of the APPLICATION object you want to test.",
        "The following steps outline a typical workflow for testing an APPLICATION object:",
        "Create an APPLICATION object using contents on a stage.",
        "This allows you to quickly test a new version of a setup script or application code file.\nRefer to Create an application using staged files for more information.",
        "Create an APPLICATION object from a version or patch.",
        "After defining a version or patch for an application package, you can test this version by\ncreating an APPLICATION object using this version. Refer to Create an application object from a version or patch level.",
        "Upgrade an APPLICATION object.",
        "After verifying that a version of an application package is working correctly, you can upgrade\nan existing APPLICATION object to the new version. You can upgrade in one of two ways:",

        "Create an APPLICATION object directly from an application package.",
        "After verifying that the APPLICATION object works correctly, you can create an APPLICATION object\nfrom an application package without specifying a version or stage files. This creates the\nAPPLICATION object using the default release directive.",
        "Refer to Create an application using staged files for more information.",
        "Install an Snowflake Native App from a listing.",
        "After verifying in your account that both the application package and APPLICATION object are working\ncorrectly, you can add the application package to a listing and test the installation using Snowsight.",
        "Refer to Create an application using staged files for more information.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework allows you to install an APPLICATION object directly in your account\nto test a Snowflake Native App before it is shared with customers. The CREATE APPLICATION\ncommand supports different syntax for creating an APPLICATION object.",
        "Note",
        "The following sections assume that you have created an application package and\nthe required manifest file and setup script.",
        "You can create an APPLICATION object using a manifest file and setup script uploaded to a named\nstage. This allows you to test changes to these files without having to\nadd a version to an application package.",
        "Use the CREATE APPLICATION command to create an APPLICATION object\nusing staged files as shown in the following example:",
        "After specifying a version or patch level in an application package you can create an APPLICATION object\nbased on that version or patch level.",

        "To create an APPLICATION object from a specific patch level, use the\nCREATE APPLICATION command as shown in the following example:",
        "After specifying a release directive in an application package you can create an\nAPPLICATION object based on the release directive. This can be a custom release directive or the\ndefault release directive.",
        "To create an application package based on a release directive use the\nCREATE APPLICATION command as shown in the following example:",
        "To upgrade an APPLICATION object using files on a named stage, use the\nALTER APPLICATION command as shown in the following example:",
        "To upgrade an APPLICATION object that was created using a specific a version, use the\nALTER APPLICATION command as shown in the following example:",
        "To see a list of APPLICATION objects available to your account, use the SHOW APPLICATIONS command as shown in\nthe following example:",
        "When you create an APPLICATION object from an application package by\nspecifying a version or\napplication files on a named stage,\nthe APPLICATION object is considered to be in development mode.",
        "Development mode allows you to test and troubleshoot an APPLICATION object within a single account.\nIn development mode you can create and test an APPLICATION object based on a specific version of an\napplication package. You can also create and test an APPLICATION object using application files on a stage.\nThis enables you to quickly test changes to the setup script or application logic.",
        "Development mode provides an additional debug mode that\nallows you to verify the internal state of an APPLICATION object that a consumer would otherwise\nnot be able to view.",
        "In development mode, for example, running the SHOW or DESC commands on objects within the\nAPPLICATION object will only display those objects that the consumer has been granted permissions to view.\nHowever in DEBUG mode, you can see all objects within the APPLICATION object.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework allows you to test an APPLICATION object in debug mode. Debug mode allows you\nto view and modify all of the objects within the APPLICATION object. Objects that are not visible to a\nconsumer, for example, objects not granted to a database role or shared content objects, are visible\nwhile in this mode.",
        "Using an APPLICATION object in debug mode requires the following:",
        "The APPLICATION object must be created in development mode, meaning it must be based on a specific version or\nfiles on a stage.",
        "You must explicitly set debug mode on the APPLICATION object.",
        "Note",
        "Debug mode can only be toggled on and off for APPLICATION object created in development mode within\nthe same account containing the application package.",
        "To enable debug mode on an APPLICATION object, use the ALTER APPLICATION\ncommand as shown in the following example:",
        "This command turns on debug mode for an APPLICATION object named hello_snowflake_app.\nLikewise, to turn off debug mode, use the same command as shown in the following example:",
        "This command turns off debug mode for the APPLICATION object named hello_snowflake_app.",
        "Note",
        "To run this command, you must have the OWNERSHIP privilege on the APPLICATION object .\nYou must also have the DEVELOP privilege on the application package.",
        "Additionally, the APPLICATION object must be created in development mode and in the same account\nas the application package.",
        "To set an APPLICATION object as the active, current context for a session, run the\nUSE APPLICATION command as shown in the following example:",
