        "Identifier for the resource monitor; must be unique for your account.",
        "The identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier string\nis enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "For more details, see Identifier requirements.",
        "The number of credits allocated to the resource monitor per frequency interval. When total usage for all warehouses assigned to the\nmonitor reaches this number for the current frequency interval, the resource monitor is considered to be at 100% of quota.",
        "If a value is not specified for a resource monitor, the monitor has no quota and will never reach 100% usage within the specified interval.",
        "Default: No value (i.e. no credit quota)",
        "The frequency interval at which the credit usage resets to 0.",
        "If you set a frequency for a resource monitor, you must also set START_TIMESTAMP.",
        "If you specify NEVER for the frequency, the credit usage for the warehouse does not reset.",
        "Default: No value (i.e. legacy behavior, whereby the credit quota resets at the beginning of each calendar month)",
        "The date and time when the resource monitor starts monitoring credit usage for the assigned warehouses.",
        "If you set a timestamp for a resource monitor, you must also set FREQUENCY.",
        "If you specify IMMEDIATELY for the start timestamp, the current timestamp is used.",
        "If you specify a date without a time, the current time is used.",
        "If you set a time without specifying a time zone, UTC is used as the default time zone.",
        "Default: No value (i.e. legacy behavior, whereby the resource monitor starts monitoring warehouses immediately)",
        "The date and time when the resource monitor suspends the assigned warehouses.",
        "Default: No value (i.e. no warehouse suspension date)",
        "Specifies the list of users to receive email notifications on resource monitors. If a user identifier includes spaces or special\ncharacters or is case-sensitive, then the identifier must be enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \u201cMary Smith\u201d). See\nIdentifier requirements for details.",
        "The user identifier, user_name, is the value of the name column from the output of\nSHOW USERS.",
        "Each user listed must have a verified email address. For instructions on verifying email addresses in the web interface, see:",

        "Specifies one or more triggers for the resource monitor. Each trigger definition consists of the following:",
        "A numeric value specified as a percentage of the credit quota for the resource monitor; values larger than 100 are supported.\nOnce usage reaches this threshold for the current frequency interval, the trigger fires.",
        "Specifies the action performed by the trigger when the threshold is reached:",
        "SUSPEND: Suspend all assigned warehouses while allowing currently running queries to complete. No new queries can be executed\nby the warehouses until the credit quota for the resource monitor is increased. In addition, this action sends a notification to all\nusers who have enabled notifications for themselves.",
        "SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE:  Suspend all assigned warehouses immediately and cancel any currently running queries or statements using\nthe warehouses. In addition, this action sends a notification to all users who have enabled notifications for themselves.",
        "NOTIFY: Send a notification (to all account administrators with notifications enabled), but do not take any other action.",
        "Default: No value (i.e. resource monitor performs no actions)",
        "Triggers are optional; however, at least one trigger must be added to a resource monitor before it can perform any actions.",
        "Each resource monitor supports up to a maximum of 5 NOTIFY action triggers.",
        "After a resource monitor is created, it must be assigned to a warehouse or account before it can perform any monitoring actions:",
        "To assign a warehouse to a resource monitor, use ALTER WAREHOUSE (or CREATE WAREHOUSE if you are creating the warehouse).",
        "To assign a resource monitor at the account level, use ALTER ACCOUNT. The NOTIFY_USERS parameter must be null.",
        "To view all resource monitors created in your account and their assignment, use the SHOW RESOURCE MONITORS command. The command\noutput displays NULL in the level column for resource monitors that are not assigned to the account or any warehouses\nand, therefore, are not monitoring any credit usage.",
        "If frequency and start_timestamp parameters are set on a resource monitor, the day for the credit usage reset is\ncalculated based on those parameters. The time the credit usage resets to 0 is 12:00 AM UTC regardless of the time specified in\nstart_timestamp.",
        "If you specify an end_timestamp, monitoring ends at that specified date and time and all assigned warehouses are suspended\nat that date and time even if the credit quota has not been reached.",
        "When this occurs, a notification is sent that states the resource monitor has reached a percentage of its quota and has triggered a\nsuspend immediate action. The percentage of the quota reflects the number of credits used in the current interval up to the end date\nand might not be a threshold you specified.",
        "If there are non-administrator users in the notification list, the following notes apply:",
        "If any user in the notification list does not have a verified email,\nthe SQL statement fails.",
        "If any user in the notification list changes their email address and does not verify the new email address, the\nnotification silently fails.",
        "The notification list is limited to a maximum number of 5 non-administrator users.",

        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",

In addition, to receive email notifications, users must have a\nverified email in their preferences. Preferences can only\nbe set in the Snowflake web interface. For more information, see Enabling receipt of notifications.",
        "Create a resource monitor named limiter with 3 triggers:",
