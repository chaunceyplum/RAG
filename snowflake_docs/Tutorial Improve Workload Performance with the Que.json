        "Typically, the warehouses that would benefit the most are the ones that either have the largest number of eligible queries, the most\namount of eligible query acceleration time, or a combination of the two. For example, if a warehouse is in the top of the results for\nboth of the queries above, that warehouse might be a good candidate for query acceleration.",
        "After you have decided which warehouse(s) would benefit the most from the query acceleration service, you can enable query acceleration\nby executing the following ALTER WAREHOUSE statement:",
