        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework enables providers to update a Snowflake Native App to add new functionality,\nfix bugs, and make other changes. Providers can create new versions or patches of\nand app and upgrade the app in the consumer account.",
        "Understand the version and upgrade process for an app.",
        "Before developing a new version or patch of an app, providers should understand the version\nlifecycle for an app and how the upgrade process works. See Overview of app versions and upgrades for\ninformation.",
        "Develop and test the updated app local.",
        "Providers develop and test new versions or patches locally before publishing them to consumers. See\nDevelop a new version of an app for guidelines on how to develop a new version or patch. See Use versioned schema to manage app objects across versions\nfor information on how to handle objects during the upgrade.",
        "Add the version or patch to the application package.",
        "After developing and testing a new version or patch locally, providers create a new version or patch\nfor the app. Version and patch information are stored in the application package. See Create versions and patches for an app for\ninformation on creating versions and patches.",
        "Note",
        "If an application package already has two versions for an app defined in the\napplication package, providers must drop one of the versions before adding a new version.",
        "Wait for the results of the automated security scan.",
        "If the DISTRIBUTION property of the application package is set to EXTERNAL, creating a new version\nor patch iniitiates the automated security scan. The app must pass the security scan before it can be\npublished to the Snowflake Marketplace.",
        "For information on setting the DISTRIBUTION property and the automated security scan, see\nRun the automated security scan.",
        "Upgrade the app.",
        "Upgrades are initiated when the provider updates the\nrelease directive of the application package.",
        "This initiates the upgrade process for all installed apps that are on the previous\nversion. However, a provider can ask a consumer to perform a manual upgrade\nif the consumer needs to upgrade their app before the automated upgrade is complete.",
        "Monitor the upgrade.",
        "After the upgrade begins, providers can monitor the upgrade in their account by querying the\nAPPLICATION_STATE view.",
        "See Monitor the state of an upgrade for information on monitoring an app upgrade and the\npossible upgrade statuses.",
        "Update the listing for the app.",
        "After an app passes the security scan and the provider sets the release directive,\nSnowflake automatically updates the version and patch for the listing. However, providers\nmay still need to update the listing to describe new functionality to the consumer.",
