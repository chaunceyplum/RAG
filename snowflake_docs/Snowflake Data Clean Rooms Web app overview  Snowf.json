        "The web app of a Snowflake Data Clean Room provides a user interface to create, share, and use a\nSnowflake Data Clean Room. It allows non-technical business users to collaborate in a\nsecure environment. Tasks within the clean room are simplified, for example:",
        "Providers use drop-down lists to select which tables to share and which columns the consumer can join on.",
        "Providers choose from pre-defined analysis templates to control how a consumer accesses data in the clean room.",
        "Consumers run powerful analyses without using SQL or any other programming language.",
        "Before you can use the web app, an administrator must configure the clean room environment and add you as a user. For details, see\nGet started with Snowflake Data Clean Rooms.",
        "Once an administrator has added you to the clean room, you can sign in to the web app using the following procedure:",
        "Navigate to the Snowflake Data Clean Rooms login page.",
        "Enter your email address, and select Continue.",
        "Enter your password.",
        "Do one of the following:",
        "If you\u2019ve set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) before, enter the one-time code from your authentication app.",
        "If this is your first time signing in, scan the QR code with an authentication app to\nenable MFA. Then do the following:",
        "When prompted, enter the one-time code from the app.",
        "Copy the recovery code to a separate location in case the authentication app is unavailable on your device when you sign in.",
        "If you are associated with multiple clean rooms, select the Snowflake account associated with the clean room you want to work with.",
        "All web app users must log in using multi-factor authentication (MFA). Snowflake recommends using one of the following third-party\nauthenticator apps:",
        "Authy",
        "Google Authenticator",
        "Auth0 Guardian",
        "Microsoft Authenticator",
        "Once MFA is enabled, you will be prompted to enter a one-time code from the authenticator app every time you sign in to the web app.",
