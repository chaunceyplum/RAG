        "Within differential privacy in Snowflake, a privacy domain defines the possible\nvalues in a column, similar to a mathematical domain. A privacy domain is either a range of values with a minimum and maximum or an\nenumerated list of values.",
        "The privacy domain is one factor that Snowflake uses to calculate the amount of noise that\nmust be added to preserve privacy. Because of this, most fields should have a finite privacy domain; otherwise, the amount of noise added\nwould need to be infinite. By default, fields without privacy domains are assumed to have an infinite domain.",
        "With the exception of a COUNT function, a query cannot aggregate a column unless the column has a privacy domain. Similarly, a query cannot\nuse a column in a GROUP BY clause unless the column has a privacy domain. For example, both the score and age columns in the\nfollowing example must have privacy domains.",
        "These requirements don\u2019t apply to subqueries. For example, in the following query, the mean_age column must have a privacy domain, but\nthe score and age columns don\u2019t, even though they\u2019re used in an aggregation.",
        "While both administrators and the analysts who are running queries can define a privacy domain for a column, they do so in different ways:",
        "An administrator uses CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE commands to set a privacy domain for a column. An administrator for the data provider\nsets privacy domains before giving access to analysts. In some circumstances, an\nadministrator for the analyst might also need to set privacy domains on tables being joined with the data provider\u2019s protected tables. If\nyou\u2019re an administrator who needs to set privacy domains, see Working with privacy domains as an administrator.",
        "An analyst shapes a query to implicitly specify a privacy domain using query elements like filters and column transformations. These\nprivacy domains can be specified for columns without a privacy domain or can narrow a privacy domain set by the data provider. If you\u2019re\nan analyst who needs to specify or narrow a privacy domain, see Working with privacy domains as an analyst.",
        "Multiple privacy domains can be involved in a query. There can be an admin-specified privacy domain and an analyst-specified privacy\ndomain on the same column. Alternatively, a query might join two tables on a column that has a privacy domain in both tables.",
        "Snowflake evaluates all privacy domains and calculates the privacy domain to use for the duration of the query. For information about\nhow this query-time privacy domain is determined, see:",
        "Interaction between admin-specified and analyst-specified privacy domains",
        "Privacy domains and joins",
        "An analyst uses query elements to implicitly specify a privacy domain for a column. For example, filtering on a column defines a privacy\ndomain for it. This analyst-specified privacy domain exists only for the duration of the query; it doesn\u2019t change the privacy domain that\nan administrator set on the column.",
        "An analyst-specified privacy domain can narrow an admin-specified privacy domain, but can never expand it. The query-time privacy domain\nis the intersection between the privacy domain specified by the query and the privacy domain set by the administrator. For example, if the\ndata provider set the privacy domain as a range (5, 15) and the query uses filters to specify the privacy domain as a range (0, 10), then\nthe effective, query-time privacy domain is (5, 10).",
        "Similarly, if the administrator set the privacy domain as a list ( \u2018blue\u2019, \u2018yellow\u2019 ) and the query uses filters to specify a\nprivacy domain of ( \u2018orange\u2019, \u2018blue\u2019) , the query-time privacy domain is ( \u2018blue\u2019 ).",
        "When an analyst joins two tables on a column that has a privacy domain in both tables, the type of join determines the\nquery-time privacy domain. During the duration of the query, the effective privacy domain can be the intersection of the two privacy\ndomains, the union of the two privacy domains, or just one of the privacy domains.",
        "In the following table, domainL refers to the privacy domain on the join column in the left table and domainR refers to the privacy\ndomain on the join column in the right table.",

        "For example, suppose the day column in t1 has a privacy domain of (1, 100) and the day column in t2 has a privacy domain of\n(0, 90). When an analyst joins t1 and t2 on day, the query-time privacy domain is (1, 90), which is the intersection of the two\nprivacy domains.",
        "A privacy domain defines possible values in a column, not necessarily actual values. The following summarizes what happens to values\nthat are not included in the list or range of the privacy domain.",
        "Values in a string column that fall outside the privacy domain are always treated as NULL for the duration of the query. This is true\nregardless of whether it is an admin-specified privacy domain, an analyst-specified privacy domain, or an intersection of privacy\ndomains.",
        "For example, suppose the data provider set a privacy domain on a column state of ('california', 'oregon') and the analyst\nwrote a query that filters the state column to ('nevada', 'oregon'). If the query uses the state column in a GROUP BY\nclause, then the result contains two groups: OREGON and NULL. The NULL group includes all records where the value of\nthe state column is not OREGON along with records where the value of the state column is literally NULL.",
        "Snowflake treats numeric, date, or time values that fall outside the range of a privacy domain differently depending on\nwhether the privacy domain was defined by an administrator or an analyst.",
        "When the data provider defines a range privacy domain that contains a subset of the column\u2019s actual values, the values outside the\nprivacy domain are clamped, meaning they are treated as if they are the nearest value in the domain (the minimum or maximum\nvalue). For example, if the privacy domain of a column consists of integers between 1-100, a record with an actual value of 105 is\ntreated as if it has a value of 100 when calculating aggregations. Analysts cannot access values outside the privacy domain.",
        "When a join of two privacy-protected tables results in the intersection of privacy\ndomains, values outside the query-time privacy domain are clamped.",
        "When an analyst specifies a privacy domain for a column that doesn\u2019t have one or narrows an admin-specified privacy domain, the\nquery itself determines what happens to values that fall outside the privacy domain.",
        "If the query uses a filter (WHERE clause), values outside of\nthe privacy domain are ignored when calculating aggregations.",
        "If the query uses a column transformation, values in\nthe column that are outside of the privacy domain are clamped like an admin-specified privacy domain.",
        "How a query is written can affect whether the range of a privacy domain changes or even whether a privacy domain still exists on a column.\nThis section helps you understand how intermediary parts of a query, that is, parts of the query before the final aggregation, can affect\nthe privacy domain of a column.",
        "If a query adds a new column that is based on an existing column, specifying or narrowing a privacy domain on the original column has no\neffect on the new column.",
        "In the following example, assume the data provider defined the privacy domain on the score column as a range between 0 and 100. When\nthe query specifies the privacy domain of score as a range between 1 and 2, it has no effect on the privacy domain of the column\nscore_derived.",
        "For example, the output might be:",
        "For intermediary portions of a query, using a GROUP BY clause while aggregating a column removes the privacy domain from the column. As a\nresult, you need to specify a new privacy domain on the column if it is used in the final aggregation of the query.",
        "In the following example, the initial aggregation removes any privacy domain that has been set on the score column. The query succeeds\nonly because it sets a privacy domain on the alias of the column before the final aggregation.",
