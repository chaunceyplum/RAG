        "Returns the portion of the string or binary value from base_expr, starting from the character/byte specified by start_expr,\nwith optionally limited length.",
        "These functions are synonymous.",
        "LEFT , RIGHT",
        "An expression that evaluates to a VARCHAR or BINARY value.",
        "An expression that evaluates to an integer. It specifies the offset from which the substring starts. The offset is measured in:",
        "The number of UTF-8 characters if the input is a VARCHAR value.",
        "The number of bytes if the input is a BINARY value.",
        "The start position is 1-based, not 0-based. For example, SUBSTR('abc', 1, 1) returns a, not b.",
        "An expression that evaluates to an integer. It specifies:",
        "The number of UTF-8 characters to return if the input is VARCHAR.",
        "The number of bytes to return if the input is BINARY.",
        "Specify a length that is greater than or equal to zero. If the length is a negative number, the function returns an\nempty string.",
        "The data type of the returned value is the same as the data type of the base_expr (VARCHAR or BINARY).",
        "If any of the inputs are NULL, NULL is returned.",
        "If length_expr is specified, up to length_expr characters/bytes are\nreturned. If length_expr isn\u2019t specified, all the characters until the end of the string or\nbinary value are returned.",
        "The values in start_expr start from 1:",
        "If 0 is specified, it is treated as 1.",
        "If a negative value is specified, the starting position is computed as\nthe start_expr characters/bytes from the end of the string or binary\nvalue. If the position is outside of the range of a string or binary\nvalue, an empty value is returned.",
        "Collation applies to VARCHAR inputs. Collation doesn\u2019t apply if the input data type of the first parameter\nis BINARY.",
        "No impact. Although collation is accepted syntactically, collations don\u2019t affect processing. For example,\ntwo-character and three-character letters in languages (for example, \u201cdzs\u201d in Hungarian or \u201cch\u201d in Czech)\nare still counted as two or three characters (not one character) for the length argument.",
        "The collation of the result is the same as the collation of the input. This can be useful if the returned value is passed to another function as part of nested function calls.",
        "The following examples use the SUBSTR function.",
        "The following example uses the SUBSTR function to return the portion of the string that starts at the\nninth character and limits the length of the returned value to three characters:",
        "The following example shows the substrings returned for the same base_expr when different\nvalues are specified for start_expr and length_expr:",
        "The following examples return substrings for customer information in a table.",
        "Create the table and insert data:",
        "Use the POSITION function with the SUBSTR function to extract the domains from email addresses.\nThis example finds the position of @ in each string and starts from the next character by adding\none:",
        "Tip",
        "You can use the POSITION function to find the position of other characters, such as an empty\ncharacter (' ') or an underscore (_).",
        "In the cust_phone column in the table, the area code is always the first three characters. Extract\nthe area code from phone numbers:",
        "Remove the area code from phone numbers:",
