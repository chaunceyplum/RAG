        "This topic provides instructions for creating an API integration object in Snowflake to work with your proxy service (i.e. Azure API\nManagement service). The instructions are the same regardless of whether you are using the Azure Portal or ARM template.",

        "Azure Function App AD Application ID (from your tracking worksheet)",
        "Azure AD Tenant ID (as described in the Prerequisites section for planning an external\nfunction)",
        "Use the CREATE API INTEGRATION command to create the API integration object:",
        "Open a Snowflake session, typically a Snowflake web interface session.",
        "Execute the USE ROLE command to use the ACCOUNTADMIN role or a role with the CREATE INTEGRATION privilege. For example:",
        "Enter a CREATE API INTEGRATION statement. The statement should look similar to the following:",
        "In the statement:",
        "Replace <integration_name> with a unique integration name (e.g. my_api_integration_name). The name must follow the rules for\nObject identifiers.",
        "In addition, record the integration name in the API Integration Name field in your tracking worksheet. You will need the name when\nyou execute the CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION command later in the creation process.",

        "The URL you enter depends on whether you are using the Azure Portal or ARM template to create your external function:",
