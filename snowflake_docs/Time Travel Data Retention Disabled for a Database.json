        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "When a data consumer creates a local database from a provider share, that database inherits the\ndefault Time Travel retention period (i.e. the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter\nsetting). If the database is dropped, its historical data is saved for the specified data retention period. However, once a database\ncreated from a share is dropped, it cannot be recovered from Time Travel (e.g. undropped) regardless of the data retention period setting.",
        "This behavior has changed as follows:",
        "When a database created from a share was dropped, its historical data was saved for the retention period specified by the inherited\nvalue of the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter. However Time Travel could not be used to recover the database (e.g. the database\ncould not be undopped) regardless of the data retention period.",
        "When a database is created from a share, the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter value is 0.",
