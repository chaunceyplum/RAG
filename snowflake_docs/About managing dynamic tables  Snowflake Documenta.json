        "Use SQL commands to list dynamic tables and view details",
        "To list the dynamic tables in a schema and view information about a dynamic table:",

        "Select a database and schema.",
        "On the Schema Details, select the Dynamic Tables tab.",
        "Note that you can also view the list of dynamic tables in the database object explorer by expanding Dynamic Tables.",
        "To view information about a specific dynamic table, select the dynamic table in the database object explorer or in the list of\ndynamic tables in the Dynamic Tables tab.",
        "The tabs on this page provide some of the same information as the table details page,\nincluding:",
        "The definition of the dynamic table and the privileges granted for working with the dynamic table",
        "Information about the columns in the dynamic table",
        "A preview of up to 100 rows of the data in the dynamic table",
        "In addition, the dynamic table details page includes tabs that you can use to view information about the dynamic table:",
        "The Graph tab displays the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that\nincludes this dynamic table. See Use Snowsight to examine the graph of dynamic tables.",
        "The Refresh History tab displays the history of refreshes. See\nUse Snowsight to monitor refreshes.",
        "To list the dynamic tables in the current database (or in the account, if no database is currently in use), use the SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES command.",
        "For example, to list the dynamic tables with names that start with product_ in the database mydb and schema myschema, execute the following SQL statement:",
        "For the full syntax of the command, see SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES.",
        "To output information about the columns in a dynamic table, use the DESCRIBE DYNAMIC TABLE command.",
        "For example, to list the columns in the dynamic table named product:",
        "Dynamic tables are also included in the results of the TABLES view.",
        "To drop a dynamic table, you can use either Snowsight or SQL commands.",
        "In Snowsight, open the dynamic table details page (instructions).",
        "On the More menu in the upper-right corner of the page, select Drop.",
        "Use the DROP DYNAMIC TABLE command.",
        "For example, to drop the dynamic table named product:",
        "Dynamic tables are shareable objects. To share a dynamic table, data sharing providers grant\nprivileges on a dynamic table to a share, which in turn can be used by data sharing consumers.",
        "Providers can share selected dynamic tables with other Snowflake accounts using direct shares\nor listings, which allow data to be shared between accounts without physically moving it. The\nprocess involves creating a share of a database within the\nprovider\u2019s account, granting database access within the provider\u2019s account, granting access\nprivileges, and adding other objects to the share. To learn more, see\nAbout Secure Data Sharing and Data sharing and collaboration in Snowflake.",
        "A data sharing provider can choose to grant the SELECT privilege on a single dynamic table or\ngrant the SELECT privilege on all dynamic tables in a database, as shown in the following\nexamples.",
        "For more details, see GRANT <privilege> \u2026 TO SHARE.",
        "To create a dynamic table to ingest shared data, do the following:",
        "Ensure that you have the right privileges, and create a database from a share and grant privileges on it.",
        "Grant privileges to the shared database.",
        "Create a shared dynamic table.",
        "Note",
        "Change tracking must be enabled on all underlying objects used by a dynamic table. To use a\ndynamic table to ingest shared data, the data sharing provider needs to enable\nchange_tracking on the shared object. See Enable change tracking.",
        "When you use a dynamic table to ingest shared data, the query can\u2019t select from a\nshared dynamic table or a shared secure view that references an upstream dynamic\ntable.",
        "To change the warehouse or target lag for a dynamic table, use the ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE command.",
        "For example, to change the warehouse for the dynamic table product to my_other_wh, run:",
        "The following diagram illustrates suspend, resume, and manual refresh operations in the context of upstream\nand downstream relationships to other dynamic tables.",
        "The diagram depicts a simple declarative data pipeline built with dynamic tables. Similar to water\nflowing in a stream, data in a dynamic table pipeline flows from the root downstream toward the leaf\ndynamic table:",
        "DT2 is described as downstream of DT1 because it depends on that dynamic table, and as upstream of\nDT3, which depends on it.",
        "DT3 is downstream of both DT2 and DT1 because it depends on DT2 directly and on DT1 indirectly.",
        "DT1 is directly or indirectly upstream of the other dynamic tables.",
        "For additional details and examples of using downstream target lag, see Understanding target lag.",
        "To determine the optimal target lag time for a dynamic table, you can use either Snowsight or\nSQL commands.",
        "On the dynamic table details page, select the Refresh History tab.",
        "Check the maximum actual lag time, which is displayed at the top of the tab.\nThis metric is based on the actual lag time for each refresh.",
        "Use the DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY table function in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.\nThis function returns information about each refresh of a dynamic table, including the time taken for the refresh and which refreshes were skipped.",
        "The lag time that you choose can affect the refresh schedule determined by the automated refresh process. The automated refresh\nprocess chooses a schedule that best meets the lag times of the dynamic tables.",
        "To determine whether an incremental or full refresh is used to update a dynamic table, you can use either\nSnowsight or SQL commands.",
        "Go to the dynamic table details page.",
        "The basic details at the top of the page indicate whether incremental or full refreshes are used for that table.",
        "Use the SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES command, and check the value of the REFRESH_MODE column in the output.",
        "REFRESH_MODE_REASON contains additional details on the choice of REFRESH_MODE.",
        "The columns in the base tables, views, and underlying dynamic tables can change over time.\nSome changes can affect the dynamic table itself; others may have limited or no impact.",
        "When the underlying objects associated with a dynamic table change, the following behaviors apply:",
        "Change",
        "Impact",
        "New column added.",
        "Existing unused column removed.",
        "None. If a new column is added to the base table or an unused column is deleted, no action occurs and refreshes continue as before.",
        "Underlying base table is recreated with identical column names and types.",
        "Underlying base table column is recreated with the same name and type.",
        "Full refresh/reinitialize: During the next refresh cycle, a full refresh is done to ensure that no incorrect or stale data is in the dynamic table.",
        "An underlying column or other element used by a dynamic table changes in name or in some other way.",
        "The state of the dynamic table changes to FAILED. The dynamic table must be recreated to respond to the change.",
        "Note",
        "A dynamic table is suspended if the system observes five continuous refresh errors.\nDynamic tables suspended due to refresh errors are commonly referred to as auto-suspended because they are suspended\nby the system and not through user action.",
        "Any dynamic tables that depend on the suspended dynamic table are also suspended.\nSCHEDULING_STATE describes the current state of a dynamic table.",
        "To view the scheduling state of the dynamic table, call the DYNAMIC_TABLE_GRAPH_HISTORY table function, and examine the SCHEDULING_STATE column.",
