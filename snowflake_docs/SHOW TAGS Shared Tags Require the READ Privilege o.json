        "The behavior of the SHOW TAGS command with respect to data sharing is as follows:",
        "If a data sharing provider shares a schema that stores tags, the consumer can view all of the shared tags using a SHOW TAGS command\nprovided that the role that executes the SHOW TAGS command has the required privileges to access the shared schema.",
        "As a consumer, to use the SHOW TAGS command to view shared tags, you must use a role that is granted the READ privilege on each tag. The\nREAD privilege for a tag is new and is only applicable in a data sharing context.",

        "Grant the READ privilege on each tag to the share directly.",
        "Grant the READ privilege on the tag to a database role and grant the database role to the share.",
        "The consumer:",
        "Creates a database from the share and grants privileges on the share to account roles (no changes).",
        "Grants the database role to an account role (if applicable, no changes).",
        "Uses SQL to execute the SHOW TAGS command.",
