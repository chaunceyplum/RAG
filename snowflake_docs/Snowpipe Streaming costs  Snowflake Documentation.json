        "With Snowpipe Streaming\u2019s serverless compute model, users can stream any data volume without managing a virtual warehouse. Instead, Snowflake provides and manages the compute resources, automatically growing or shrinking capacity based on the current Snowpipe Streaming load.",
        "Accounts are charged based on the per-second time that serverless compute and active client streaming ingestion uses. Note the following:",
        "File migration occurs asynchronously from streaming ingestion.",
        "File migration might be pre-empted by clustering or other DML operations.",
        "File migration might not always occur, and therefore compute costs might be reduced.",
        "For Snowflake-managed Apache Iceberg\u2122 tables, file migration operates similarly to Iceberg table maintenance to create new compacted Parquet files, if necessary.",
        "For more information, see the \u201cServerless Feature Credit Table\u201d in the Snowflake Service Consumption Table.",
        "Given the number of factors that can differentiate Snowpipe Streaming loads, it is very difficult for Snowflake to provide sample costs. Size of records, number of records, data types, etc. can affect the compute resource consumption for file migration. Client charges are dictated only by how many clients are actively writing data to Snowflake on a per-second basis.",
        "We suggest that you experiment by performing a typical streaming ingestion load to estimate future charges.\nTo see a sample streaming ingestion experiment with estimated costs, see this blog post.",
        "Note",
        "Snowpipe Streaming ingestion to Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables is available free of charge for a limited period of time.",
        "Account administrators (users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) or users with a role granted the MONITOR USAGE global privilege can use SQL commands to view the credits billed to your Snowflake account within a specified date range. You can use the following views to query the history of data migrated into Snowflake tables, the amount of time spent loading data into Snowflake tables using Snowpipe Streaming, and the credits consumed.",
        "To view the total Snowpipe Streaming costs, including both compute and client costs, query the metering history when the SERVICE_TYPE is set to SNOWPIPE_STREAMING.",
        "METERING_HISTORY view (in Account Usage).",
        "For more information about querying the total Snowpipe Streaming costs, see a SQL example.",
        "To see the detailed breakdowns of client ingestion and migration compute, you can query the following views:",
