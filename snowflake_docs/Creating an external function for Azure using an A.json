        "These topics provide detailed instructions for using an ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template to create an external function hosted on\nMicrosoft Azure.",
        "Snowflake provides a sample template that you can start with. This template hides some details of the creation process and hard-codes\nsome names (e.g. trigger name) and functionality. When you are ready to create your own custom external function, you can either customize\na copy of the template or you can use the Azure Portal to create the function.",
