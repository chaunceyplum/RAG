        "In this query, the customer.name attribute needs to be in the GROUP BY to be included in the result. This is unnecessary\n(for example, when customer.id is known to be unique) and makes the computation\npossibly more complex and slower. Another option is to use an aggregate function. For example:",
        "This simplifies the GROUP BY clause, but still requires computing the MIN function, which incurs an extra cost.",
