The Trust Center evaluates your account against\nrecommendations specified in scanners according to a schedule, but you can change\nhow frequently scanners run. If your account violates any of the recommendations\nin any of the enabled scanners, then the Trust Center provides a list of security risks, and\ninformation about how to mitigate those risks.",

        "The Trust Center supports private connectivity. For more information, see\nUsing private connectivity.",
        "The Trust Center provides a Findings tab that provides the following information:",
        "A graph of scanner violations over time, color coded by low, medium, high, and critical severity.",
        "An interactive list of recommendations for each violation found. Each recommendation contains details about the violation, when the\nscanner was last run, and how to remediate the violation.",
        "Findings let you identify Snowflake configurations in the account that violate the requirements of\nenabled scanner packages. For each violation, the Trust Center provides an explanation of how to\nremediate the violation. After you remediate a violation, the violation still appears in the Findings tab until the\nnext scheduled run of the scanner package containing the scanner that reported the violation begins, or until you\nrun the scanner package manually.",
        "You need specific a application role to access the Findings tab. For more information, see\nRequired privileges.",
        "A scanner is a scheduled background process that checks your account for security risks based on how you configured your account. Scanners\nare grouped together into scanner packages. Scanners contain information about what security risks they check for in your account, and the\nscanner package that contains them.",

        "By default, scanner packages are deactivated, except for the Security Essentials scanner package.",

        "You can access additional security insights by enabling the CIS Benchmarks scanner package, which contains scanners that evaluate your\naccount against the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Snowflake Benchmarks. The CIS Snowflake Benchmarks are a list of best practices for\nSnowflake account configurations meant to reduce security vulnerabilities. The CIS Snowflake Benchmarks were created through community\ncollaboration and consensus among subject matter experts.",
        "To obtain a copy of the CIS Snowflake Benchmarks document, see the\nCIS Snowflake Benchmark website.",
        "The recommendations found in the CIS Snowflake Benchmarks are numbered by section and recommendation. For example, the first recommendation\nof the first section is numbered 1.1. In the Findings tab, the Trust Center provides section numbers for each\nviolation if you want to reference the Snowflake CIS Benchmarks.",

For these benchmarks, the absence of a\nviolation does not guarantee that the security measure is implemented in an effective manner. The following benchmarks either do not\nevaluate whether your security implementations were implemented in a way that achieve their goal, or the Trust Center does not perform\nchecks for them:",

        "4.3: Ensure that the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter is set to 90 for critical data. Trust Center displays a violation if the\nDATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter associated with Time Travel  is not set to 90\ndays for the account or at least one object, but does not evaluate which data is considered critical.",
        "4.10: Ensure that data masking is enabled for sensitive data. Trust Center displays a violation if the account does not have at\nleast one masking policy, but does not evaluate whether sensitive data is protected\nappropriately. The Trust Center does not evaluate whether a masking policy is assigned to at least one table or view.",
