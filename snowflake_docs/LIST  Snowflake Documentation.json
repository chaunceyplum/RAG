        "Returns a list of files that have been staged (i.e. uploaded from a local file system or unloaded from a table) in one of the following\nSnowflake stages:",

        "namespace is the database and/or schema in which the named stage or table resides. It is optional if a database and\nschema are currently in use within the session; otherwise, it is required.",
        "path is an optional case-sensitive path for files in the cloud storage location (i.e. files have names that begin with a\ncommon string) that limits access to a set of files. Paths are alternatively called prefixes or folders by different cloud storage\nservices.",
        "Note",
        "If the stage name or path includes spaces or special characters, it must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g. '@\"my stage\"' for a\nstage named \"my stage\").",
        "Tip",
        "Specifying a path provides a scope for the LIST command, potentially reducing the amount of time required to run the command.",
        "Specifies a regular expression pattern for filtering files from the output. The command lists all files in the specified path\nand applies the regular expression pattern on each of the files found.",
        "In contrast to named stages, table and user stages are not first-class database objects; rather, they are implicit stages associated with\nthe table/user. As such, they have no grantable privileges of their own:",
        "You can always list files in your user stage (i.e. no privileges are required).",
        "To list files in a table stage, you must use a role that has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the table.",

        "For internal stages with default encryption (SNOWFLAKE_FULL), during upload the source file is encrypted with a random key, and its resulting MD5 digest will always differ from the original local file.",
        "Amazon S3 stages report the value via the S3 eTag field, which might not be an MD5 hash of the file contents.",
        "For Google Cloud stages that use a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK), md5 is expected to be NULL.",
