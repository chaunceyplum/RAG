        "To add units of time to a date, time, or timestamp (for example, add two days to a date) or subtract units of time\nfrom them, you can use the DATEADD, TIMEADD, or TIMESTAMPADD function.",

        "The unit (for example, month) used to calculate the difference determines which parts of the DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP field are\nevaluated. So, the unit determines the precision of the result.",
        "Smaller units are not used, so values are not rounded. For example, even though the difference between January 1, 2021 and\nFebruary 28, 2021 is closer to two months than to one month, the following returns one month:",

        "hour uses only the hour and disregards all the other parts.",
        "minute uses the hour and minute.",
        "second uses the hour, minute, and second, but not the fractional seconds.",
        "millisecond uses the hour, minute, second, and first three digits of the fractional seconds. Fractional\nseconds are not rounded. For example, DATEDIFF(milliseconds, '2024-02-20 21:18:41.0000', '2024-02-20 21:18:42.1239') returns 1.123 seconds,\nnot 1.124 seconds.",
