        "My dynamic table is using full refresh instead of incremental refresh.",
        "A dynamic table\u2019s actual refresh mode is determined at creation time\nand is immutable afterward. If not specified explicitly, the refresh mode defaults to AUTO, which selects a\nrefresh mode based on various factors such as query complexity, or unsupported constructs, operators, or functions.",
        "For consistent behavior across Snowflake releases, explicitly set the refresh mode on all dynamic tables. For\nexample, if you want your dynamic tables to refresh only incrementally, you must explicitly set the refresh mode to\nINCREMENTAL when creating them, keeping in mind that there might be some\nlimitations on using incremental refresh. For more information,\nsee Set the refresh mode for all production dynamic tables.",
        "Using a role with the necessary privileges, you can verify the\nrefresh mode using one of the following methods:",
        "Using SQL: Run the SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES statement. In the output, the text column shows the\nuser-specified refresh mode, the refresh_mode column shows the actual refresh mode,  and the\nrefresh_mode_reason shows why the actual refresh mode was chosen.",
        "Using Snowsight: In the navigation menu, select Monitoring \u00bb Dynamic Tables, and then\nselect your dynamic table. You can view the refresh mode for the dynamic table in the Table Details tab.",
        "My dynamic table\u2019s incremental refresh is slow.",
        "A dynamic table\u2019s refresh performance relies on specific assumptions about the workload or data it\u2019s handling.",

        "My dynamic table is running an empty refresh but I am seeing a cost.",
        "Refreshes that produce zero net new rows (that is, zero rows added, updated, or deleted) consume warehouse resources\nwhen they\u2019re associated with changes in any of the upstream objects referenced by the dynamic table.",
        "For example, if the associated virtual warehouse is suspended and no changes in base objects are identified, the\nsuspended virtual warehouse doesn\u2019t resume and no credits are consumed. This is referred to as a\nNO_DATA refresh. Conversely, if changes are\nidentified, the virtual warehouse is automatically resumed to process the updates, which consumes warehouse resources\neven if the net result is zero rows applied to the dynamic table.",
        "If you\u2019re seeing a cost but you haven\u2019t made any changes to your dynamic table, it might be due to a change in your\nsource table. You can use the Refresh History tab in Snowsight to check if virtual warehouse credits were\nconsumed:",

        "For more information, see Understanding cost for dynamic tables.",
        "My dynamic table skipped a refresh.",
        "Dynamic tables refresh on a schedule. When a scheduled refresh starts, the following situations might cause\nthe refresh to skip:",
        "If the dynamic table being refreshed has another dynamic table upstream, and the refresh for the upstream failed or was skipped.",
        "If a previous refresh for the dynamic table is still running.",
        "If the dynamic table\u2019s refresh often takes longer than the target lag, Snowflake might skip a refresh to reduce the rate of future skips.",
        "Manual refreshes are never skipped but they can cause other refreshes to skip, especially if you perform frequent manual\nrefreshes on a dynamic table. Doing so can prevent downstream dynamic tables from refreshing. For this reason, Snowflake\ndoesn\u2019t recommend you frequently perform manual refreshes on a dynamic table with downstream dynamic tables that are\nexpected to refresh according to target lag.",
        "My dynamic table\u2019s refresh failed.",
        "Like a regular Snowflake query, a dynamic table refresh can fail due to issues with the dynamic table\u2019s query definition,\ninput data (for example, parsing errors), or internal system issues.",

        "Your dynamic table might be reinitializing due to one of the following reasons:",
        "One or more of the inputs of the dynamic table are replaced. For example, if your dynamic table is defined on a view,\nand you replace the view, the dynamic table has to reinitialize.",

        "When you create a dynamic table using a CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE statement, its initial refresh takes place either at a\nscheduled time (ON_SCHEDULE) or synchronously at creation (ON_CREATE). The initial data population, or\ninitialization, depends on when this initial refresh occurs. For example, synchronous initialization triggers a refresh\nof any referenced upstream dynamic tables, which can add additional processing time to the total duration of\ninitialization.",
