        "Preview features have been implemented and tested in Snowflake; however, full usability and corner-case handling may not be complete yet.\nWe do not warranty the use of these features against defects that may produce unexpected or undesired results. Additionally, we may change\nthe behavior of features while they are in preview. If we change the behavior of a preview feature, we do our best to notify users before\nmaking the change, but we do not guarantee to always pre-announce changes.",
        "In addition, preview features can be disabled, enabled, or viewed for an entire account.\nSee Managing access to all preview features, on this page, for details.",
        "Attention",
        "Preview features are provided primarily for evaluation and testing purposes. They should not be used in production systems or with\nproduction data.",
        "For more details about the usage of preview features, see the Snowflake\nPreview Terms of Service.",
        "Availability is determined on a per-feature basis:",
        "Most preview features are Open, meaning they are enabled by default for all accounts and, therefore, openly available for use.",
        "Some preview features are provided On Request, particularly in the early stages of the preview period. To request access to these\nfeatures for your account, you must contact Snowflake.",
        "Some preview features are available only in certain Snowflake editions or in specific\ncloud platforms or regions.",
        "The following features are currently available for preview, listed roughly in the order in which they were introduced:",
