        "Executes a string that contains a SQL statement or a\nSnowflake Scripting statement.",
        "You can use EXECUTE IMMEDIATE to do the following:",
        "In a Snowflake Scripting block, execute dynamic SQL, where parts of the SQL statement aren\u2019t known\nuntil runtime. For examples, see Executing dynamic SQL in a Snowflake Scripting block.",
        "Set a session variable to a SQL statement, and reference the session variable to run the SQL statement.\nFor an example, see Setting a session variable to a statement and executing it.",
        "If you are using SnowSQL or the Classic Console, run a Snowflake Scripting anonymous block.\nFor an example, see Running an anonymous block in SnowSQL or the Classic Console.",
        "A string literal, Snowflake Scripting variable, or\nsession variable that contains a statement. A statement can be any of the following:",
        "A single SQL statement",
        "A stored procedure call",
        "A control-flow statement (for example, looping or\nbranching statement)",

        "Specifies one or more bind variables that hold values to be used in the cursor\u2019s query definition (for example,\nin a WHERE clause).",
        "EXECUTE IMMEDIATE returns the result of the executed statement. For example, if the string or variable contained a SELECT\nstatement, the result set of the SELECT statement is returned.",
        "The string_literal, variable, or session_variable must contain only one statement.\n(A block is considered one statement, even if the body of the block\ncontains multiple statements.)",

        "The following examples execute dynamic SQL in a Snowflake Scripting block.",
        "This example executes statements that are defined in two local variables in a\nSnowflake Scripting stored procedure.\nThis example also demonstrates that EXECUTE IMMEDIATE works not only with a string literal, but also\nwith an expression that evaluates to a string (VARCHAR).",
        "Note: If you are using SnowSQL, the Classic Console, or the\nexecute_stream or execute_string method in Python Connector\ncode, use this example instead (see Using Snowflake Scripting in SnowSQL, the Classic Console, and Python Connector):",
        "Call the stored procedure:",
        "This example uses EXECUTE IMMEDIATE to execute a SELECT statement that contains bind variables\nin the USING parameter in a Snowflake Scripting stored procedure. First create the table and insert\nthe data:",
        "Create the stored procedure:",

        "When you run a Snowflake Scripting anonymous block\nin SnowSQL or the Classic Console, you must specify the block as\na string literal (delimited by single quotes or double dollar signs), and you must pass the\nblock to the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE command.
