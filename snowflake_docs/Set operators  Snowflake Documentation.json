        "Set operators allow queries to be combined.",
        "Each query can itself contain query operators to allow any number of query expressions to be combined with set operators.",
        "The ORDER BY and LIMIT / FETCH clauses are applied to the result of the set operator.",
        "When using these operators:",
        "Make sure that each query selects the same number of columns.",
        "Make sure that the data type of each column is consistent across the rows from different sources.\nOne of the examples in the Examples section below\nillustrates the potential problem and solution when data types do not match.",
        "In general, the \u201cmeanings\u201d, as well as the data types, of the columns should match. The following will not\nproduce the desired results:",
        "The risk of error increases when using the asterisk to specify all columns of a table, for example:",
        "If the tables have the same number of columns, but the columns are not in the same order, the query results will\nprobably be incorrect.",
        "The names of the output columns are based on the names of the columns of the first query. For example, the following query:",
        "behaves as though the query were:",
        "The precedence of the set operators matches the ANSI and ISO SQL standards:",
        "The UNION [ALL] and MINUS (EXCEPT) operators have equal precedence.",
        "The INTERSECT operator has higher precedence than UNION [ALL] and MINUS (EXCEPT).",
        "Operators of equal precedence are processed from left to right.",
        "You can use parentheses to force the expressions to be evaluated in a different order.",
        "Not all database vendors follow the ANSI/ISO standard for precedence of set operators. Snowflake recommends using parentheses to\nspecify the order of evaluation, especially if you are porting code from another vendor to Snowflake, or writing code that you\nmight execute on other databases as well as on Snowflake.",
        "Returns rows from one query\u2019s result set which also appear in another query\u2019s result set, with duplicate elimination.",
        "Removes rows from one query\u2019s result set which appear in another query\u2019s result set, with duplicate elimination.",
        "The MINUS and EXCEPT keywords have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably.",
        "Combines the result sets from two queries:",
        "UNION combines with duplicate elimination.",
        "UNION ALL combines without duplicate elimination.",
        "The default is UNION (i.e. duplicate elimination).",
        "This example demonstrates the basic usage of the UNION operator. It also demonstrates a potential issue\nwhen data types do not match, then provides the solution.",
        "Start by creating the tables and inserting some data:",
        "Execute a UNION operation with different data types:",
        "Output:",
        "Now use explicit casting to convert the inputs to a compatible type:",
