        "Creates a new database role if it doesn\u2019t already exist, or transforms an existing database role into the role defined in the statement.\nA CREATE OR ALTER DATABASE ROLE statement follows the syntax rules of a CREATE DATABASE ROLE statement and has the same limitations as an\nALTER DATABASE ROLE statement.",

        "Specifies the identifier (i.e. name) for the database role; must be unique in the database in which the role is created.",
        "The identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier\nstring is enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "If the identifier is not fully qualified in the form of db_name.database_role_name, the command creates the database role\nin the current database for the session.",

        "Caution",
        "Avoid recreating a database role (using the OR REPLACE keywords). Behind the scenes, recreating an object (using CREATE OR REPLACE\n<object>) first drops and then creates the object. Recreating a database role drops the database role from any shares that it is\ngranted to. You must grant the database role to these shares again.",
        "If you must recreate a database role, notify any data consumers of a share that includes the database role. They must grant the database\nrole to their own account roles again.",
