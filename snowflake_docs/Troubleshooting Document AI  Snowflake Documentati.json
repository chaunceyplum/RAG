        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "Available to accounts in AWS and Microsoft Azure commercial regions, with some exceptions. For more information, see Document AI availability.",
        "The following scenarios can help you troubleshoot issues that might occur when working with Document AI.",
        "For the extracting query to work, you must store the documents for extraction in either an internal or external stage.\nEnsure that you specify the SNOWFLAKE_SSE encryption type when you create an internal stage.",
        "Error",
        "Depending on the document format, you might get an error such as one of the following:",
        "Cause",
        "You didn\u2019t specify the SNOWFLAKE_SSE encryption type when you created internal stage to store documents.",
        "Solution",
        "To create an internal stage, run the CREATE STAGE command as shown in the following example:",
        "The presigned URL of the staged documents is a required argument to <model_build_name>!PREDICT.\nTo get the presigned URL, call the GET_PRESIGNED_URL function, which has the default expiration time.",

        "Cause",
        "Presigned URL has expired.",

        "To extract information with Document AI, you need to have the Document AI model build published.\nYou don\u2019t need to publish the model build if you trained the model and didn\u2019t add new data values (ask new questions) after the training.",
