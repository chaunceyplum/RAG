        "The following example loads data from files in the named my_ext_stage stage created in Creating an S3 stage. Using pattern matching, the statement only loads files whose names start with the string sales:",

        "The following ad hoc example loads data from all files in the S3 bucket. The COPY command specifies file format options instead of referencing a named file format. This example loads CSV files with a pipe (|) field delimiter. The COPY command skips the first line in the data files:",
        "Before loading your data, you can validate that the data in the uploaded files will load correctly.",
        "To validate data in an uploaded file, execute COPY INTO <table> in validation mode using\nthe VALIDATION_MODE parameter. The VALIDATION_MODE parameter returns errors that it encounters in the file. You\ncan then modify the data in the file to ensure it loads without error.",
