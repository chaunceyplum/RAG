        "The PARSE_DOCUMENT function is a Cortex AI task-specific function that gives you the ability to extract\ntext or layout from documents stored in an internal or external stage. PARSE_DOCUMENT combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR)\ncapabilities with machine learning models to identify text content, information stored in tables, and the structural elements of PDF\ndocuments. You can use the PARSE_DOCUMENT function to extract text and document layout to build information retrieval systems on large\narchives of business documents, and to load the extracted information into structured Snowflake tables for use by your applications.",
        "The PARSE_DOCUMENT function offers OCR (default), and LAYOUT modes for processing PDF documents.",
        "PARSE_DOCUMENT OCR (default) mode is optimized for text extraction from text-heavy documents. This is the recommended option\nfor quick, easy, and effective text extraction from documents that do not have a strong semantic structure.",
        "PARSE_DOCUMENT LAYOUT (optional) mode is optimized for extracting text and layout elements like tables.\nThis is the recommended option to improve the context of a document knowledge base to optimize retrieval information systems, and Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) inference. For example, you can isolate text sections using LAYOUT elements for more targeted entity extraction\ntasks.",
        "The Cortex PARSE_DOCUMENT function is a SQL function. Because it is\nfully hosted and managed by Snowflake, using it requires no setup. This means you can point the PARSE_DOCUMENT function to a stage where\nPDF documents are stored to extract text or layout data. The following example extracts the text and layout information from the\nfile document_1.pdf on the documents stage in the parse_document database and demo schema.",
        "Note",
        "PARSE_DOCUMENT is currently incompatible with custom network policies.",
        "PARSE_DOCUMENT supports processing of documents stored in an internal Snowflake stage, or an external stage. In creating your stage,\nServer Side Encryption is required. Otherwise, PARSE_DOCUMENT will return an error that\nthe provided file isn\u2019t in the expected format or is client-side encrypted.",
