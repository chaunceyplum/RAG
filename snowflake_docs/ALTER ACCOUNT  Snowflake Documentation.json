        "Modifies an account. The ALTER ACCOUNT command has two purposes:",
        "Allows account administrators (that is, users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) to modify parameters and\nother settings at the account level. For example, the account administrator can set the resource monitor or enable a security feature for\nan account. For these actions, the account administrator executes ALTER ACCOUNT from the account being modified.",
        "Allows organization administrators (that is, users with the ORGADMIN role) to modify core characteristics of an account. For example, the\norganization administrator can rename an account. For these actions, the organization administrator executes ALTER ACCOUNT from a\ndifferent account than the one being modified.",
        "Note",
        "While ALTER ACCOUNT is primarily executed by account administrators and organization administrators, users with the SECURITYADMIN\nrole can use it to set the network policy for the account.",
        "The syntax for ALTER ACCOUNT varies depending on whether you are modifying the current account or a different account.",
        "Where:",
        "Note",
        "For readability, the complete list of session parameters that can be set for an account is not included here. For a complete list of all session\nparameters, with their descriptions, as well as account and object parameters, see Parameters.",
        "Use the following parameters when modifying the current account.",
        "For more information about setting parameters at the account level, see Parameter management. For details about a particular parameter, see Parameters.",

        "Account parameters cannot be changed by any other users.",
        "Session and object parameters set at the account level serve only as defaults and can be changed by other users.",
        "For descriptions of the parameters you can set for your account, see Parameters.",
        "Specifies one (or more) account, session, and object parameters to unset for your account, which resets them to the system defaults.",
        "You can reset multiple properties with a single ALTER statement; however, each property must be separated by a comma. When resetting a\nproperty, specify only the name; specifying a value for the property will return an error.",
        "Special parameter that specifies the name of the resource monitor used to control all virtual warehouses created in the account.",
        "Important",
        "Setting a resource monitor at the account level does not impact any of the Snowflake-provided warehouses that Snowflake uses\nfor Snowpipe, automatic reclustering, or materialized views. The credits consumed by these warehouses do not count towards the\ncredit quota for an account-level resource monitor.",
        "For more details, see Working with resource monitors.",

        "Specifies the tag name and the tag string value.",

        "Specifies an account property to set for the account.",
        "Sets an account property that determines whether the ORGADMIN role is enabled in the account. Only an organization administrator (i.e.\nuser with the ORGADMIN role) can set the property.",
        "To enable the ORGADMIN role for an account, specify SET IS_ORG_ADMIN = TRUE.",
        "You cannot set the property to FALSE from the current account. As a workaround, enable the role in a different account,\nand then switch to that account before executing the ALTER ACCOUNT command.",
        "By default, the ORGADMIN role can be enabled in a maximum of 8 accounts. If your organization requires more accounts with the ORGADMIN\nrole, contact Snowflake Support.",
        "Changes the name of an account to the specified name.",
        "Organization administrators cannot rename an account while they are logged in to it, so they must log in to a different account before\nexecuting the ALTER ACCOUNT command. If your organization consists of a single account that needs to be renamed, contact\nSnowflake Support.",
        "Optional parameter used in conjunction with RENAME TO that preserves the account URL used to\naccess Snowflake prior to renaming. By default, Snowflake saves the original URL, which means you can access the account with either\nthe old URL or the URL that contains the new account name. When set to FALSE, you must use the new URL to access the account.",
        "TRUE",
        "Removes the original account URL of an account that was renamed. Once the old URL is dropped, you must access the account with the URL that\ncontains the new account name.",
        "If an account has an old account URL because it was moved to another organization, had its organization renamed, or was part of an\norganization that was merged, use the ALTER ACCOUNT \u2026 DROP OLD ORGANIZATION URL instead.",

        "The ALTER ACCOUNT ... DROP OLD ORGANIZATION URL command is in preview, and is available to all accounts.",

        "Account had its organization renamed.",
        "Account was part of an organization that was merged with another organization.",
