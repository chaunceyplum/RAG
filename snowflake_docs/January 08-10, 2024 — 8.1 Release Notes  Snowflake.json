        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM command. This command executes the SQL statements in a file on a stage. The file must contain syntactically valid SQL statements.",
        "This feature provides a mechanism to control the deployment and management of your Snowflake objects and code. You can use the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM command to execute scripts in any session.",
        "For more information, see EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM.",
        "With Time Travel, you can create a clone of a database, schema, or table at a specified point in the object\u2019s history. However, if a database or schema contains any child objects that have a shorter data retention period than the parent object being cloned, the cloning operation fails if the child object\u2019s historical data has been purged from Time Travel. The IGNORE TABLES WITH INSUFFICIENT DATA RETENTION parameter of the CREATE <object> \u2026 CLONE command enables cloning a database or schema by ignoring those child tables that no longer have historical data available in Time Travel.",
