        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "This topic describes the security considerations for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services. In addition to the general\nsecurity requirements for all apps, apps with containers have specific security implications\nand considerations. The security review process for apps with containers includes a thorough\nexamination of the container images they contain.",
        "Snowflake uses container image scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities and\nsecurity best practice violations.",
        "Apps with containers use strict network isolation and egress control measures to help prevent unauthorized\ndata exfiltration and to protect consumer data. Each app with containers runs in its own isolated network\nenvironment, with controlled access to external systems and services.",
        "Snowflake uses network monitoring and filtering mechanisms to detect and block suspicious egress traffic\npatterns. App providers are required to explicitly declare all external end points in the application\nmanifest, which undergoes a security review.",
        "Consumer data is protected using the following:",
        "Secure data access patterns.",
        "Encryption in transit and at rest.",
        "Fine-grained access controls.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework ensures that app with containers can only access the specific data and resources to which\nan app has been granted access. This minimizes the risk of data exfiltration.",
        "Snowflake implements an additional approval process for an app with containers. The approval is\nmandatory before an app with containers can be published to the Snowflake Marketplace. Before a provider\ncan create a public or private listing for an app with containers, they  must be approved by the\nSnowflake Product Security team.",
        "Providers who successfully pass this approval process are authorized to publish a public listing\nfor an app with containers. This allows the app to be discoverable and accessible to Snowflake customers.",
        "If a provider does not pass the approval process, they may not publish a listing for an\napp with containers.",
        "When a provider sets the DISTRIBUTION=EXTERNAL property for an application package of an app with\ncontainers, Snowflake returns the following error if the provider has not been approved to publish an app with\ncontainers:",
        "If you receive this error, you must submit a\nsecurity questionnaire\nto begin the approval process.",
        "The security questionnaire assesses the following:",
        "The provider\u2019s security practices.",
        "The provider\u2019s compliance readiness.",
        "Submitting the security questionnaire begins the provider approval process.",
        "After a provider submits the security questionnaire, Snowflake\u2019s Security and Compliance\nteam evaluates each response and the documentation included by the provider.  Responses are\nevaluated to ensure alignment with industry best practices and standards.",
        "In some cases, providers may be asked to provide additional information or undergo a more in-depth\nreview to clarify any potential concerns or risks.",
        "After reviewing the questionnaire, Snowflake makes a decision to allow the provider to publish an\napp with containers. If a provider is not approved, they must wait until Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services is generally\navailable.",
        "The provider receives an email from Snowflake indicating if they are approved or wait listed\nuntil general availability.",
        "After a provider is approved, the app with containers undergoes the automated security scan. This\nscan includes a normal app security scan and a scan of the container images included in the app.",
        "The guidelines for how long the security scan takes to complete are:",
        "App size",
        "Approximate time to complete scan",
        "Five images or fewer / smaller than 40 GB",
        "Less than 8 hours",
        "Ten images or fewer / smaller than 70 GB",
        "Less than 24 hours",
        "Ten images or more / larger than 70 GB",
        "2 business days or more",
        "Caution",
