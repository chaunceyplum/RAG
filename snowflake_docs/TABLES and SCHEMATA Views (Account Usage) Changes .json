        "This behavior change is in the 2023_04 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "The data retention period for an object is determined by the retention time parameter settings set on the object and account. These parameters\nare DATA_RETENTION_TIME _IN_DAYS and MIN_DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS.",
        "If the retention time is not explicitly set for an object, it inherits the setting from its parent object.",
        "If there is no retention time set at the account level, the default retention time for the object is 1 day.",
        "The maximum retention time for a transient object is 1 day, regardless of the account-level setting.",
        "If there is a minimum retention time set for the account, and a retention time explicitly set on an object, the effective retention time is the\ngreater of the two: MAX(DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS, MIN_DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS).",
        "The RETENTION_TIME column in the Account Usage views listed below might display the incorrect value in the following scenarios:",
        "If there is no explicit retention time set for a transient table or schema, and the retention time for the account is set to 7 days, the\nRETENTION_TIME column value is 7 days. This is incorrect. The maximum data retention time for a transient object is 1 day.",
        "If the minimum retention time for an account is 7 days, and the retention time setting for a table or schema is 4 days, the RETENTION_TIME column\nvalue is 4 days. This is incorrect. The minimum account retention time is longer and therefore overrides the retention time explicitly set for the\ntable or schema.",
        "If the retention time is set to 10 days for a table or schema, then unset, the RETENTION_TIME column value is the unset value (in this case 10).\nThis might be incorrect.",
        "In the current release, the RETENTION_TIME column value changed as follows for the ACCOUNT_USAGE views listed below:",
        "TABLES View",
        "SCHEMATA View",
        "In some cases, the RETENTION_TIME column displays an incorrect data retention time for the object.",
        "The RETENTION_TIME column will display the correct data retention time for tables and schemas.",
