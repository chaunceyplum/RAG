        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "Available to accounts in AWS and Microsoft Azure commercial regions, with some exceptions. For more information, see Document AI availability.",
        "Document AI is a Snowflake AI feature that uses Arctic-TILT, a proprietary large language model (LLM), to extract data from documents.\nDocument AI processes documents of various formats and extracts information from both text-heavy paragraphs and the content in a\ngraphical form, such as logos, handwritten text (signatures), or checkmarks. With Document AI, you can prepare pipelines\nfor continuous processing of new documents of a specific type, such as invoices or finance statements.",
        "Document AI provides both zero-shot extraction and fine-tuning. Zero-shot means that the foundation model can locate\nand extract information specific to a document type, even if the model has never seen the document before. This is because the\nfoundation model is trained on a large volume of various documents, so the model broadly understands the type of document being\nprocessed.",
        "Additionally, you can fine-tune the Snowflake Arctic-TILT model to improve your results by training the model on the documents specific to your\nuse case. The fine-tuned model (including the training data used) is available only to you and is not shared with other Snowflake customers.",
        "Document AI is best used when:",
        "You want to turn unstructured data from documents into structured data in tables.",
        "You want to create pipelines for continuous processing of new documents of a specific type.",
        "Business users with domain knowledge prepare the model, and the data engineers working with SQL prepare pipelines to automate the\nprocessing of new documents.",
        "Working with Document AI is divided into two phases:",
        "Preparing a Document AI model build",
        "You can think of the model build as representing a single type of a document or a use case; for example, a model build for\nextracting information from invoice documents. The Document AI model build includes the model, the data values to be extracted,\nand the documents uploaded to test and train the model.",
        "You prepare the model build through a Document AI user interface in Snowsight. The interface lets you create a model build,\nupload documents to test and train the model, define data values (information to be extracted) by asking questions using natural\nlanguage, evaluate the model, and publish the model build or fine-tune the model to improve the results.",
        "For more information, see Prepare a Document AI model build.",
        "Extracting information from documents",
        "When the model build is ready, you can begin extracting information from documents by running an extracting query,\nwhich uses the <model_build_name>!PREDICT method.\nYou can then use the extracting query to create pipelines for continuous processing with streams and tasks.",
        "For more information, see Extract information with Document AI.",
        "Note",
        "The documents to be processed using the <model_build_name>!PREDICT method must be stored in an\ninternal or external stage.",
        "To get started with Document AI, see Tutorial: Create a document processing pipeline with Document AI.",
        "All model builds created after August 6, 2024 use a new version of the Arctic-TILT model.",
