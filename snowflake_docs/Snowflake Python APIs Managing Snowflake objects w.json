        "The Snowflake Python APIs package is a unified library that seamlessly connects Python with Snowflake workloads. It is intended to provide\ncomprehensive APIs for interacting with Snowflake resources across data engineering, Snowpark, Snowpark ML, and application workloads using\na first-class Python API.",
        "You can use the Snowflake Python APIs to manage Snowflake resources by creating, dropping, or altering them, and more. You can use\nPython to perform tasks you might otherwise perform with Snowflake SQL commands.",

        "The Snowflake Python APIs, the Snowpark API for Python, and the\nSnowflake Connector for Python are interfaces that each have distinct purposes\nin Snowflake. This section explains their differences and describes the typical use cases for each.",
        "You can use this set of first-class Python APIs to define and manage core resources (such as tables, warehouses, and tasks) across\nSnowflake workloads. Unlike the Python Connector, these APIs interact with Snowflake using native Python without the need to use SQL.",
        "The Snowflake Python APIs package unifies all Snowflake Python libraries (including connector, core, snowpark, and\nml) so that you can simply start with the command pip install snowflake.",
        "Following the declarative programming approach, this API can be used as a DevOps tool to manage changes to your resources and automate\ncode and infrastructure deployment in Snowflake.",
        "This set of libraries and code execution environments can run Python and other programming languages next to your data in Snowflake.",
        "Libraries:\u00a0With the Snowpark API, you can use Snowpark DataFrames in your code to query and transform data\nentirely within Snowflake. Snowpark applications process your data at scale directly on the Snowflake engine without moving the data to\nthe system where your application code runs.",
        "The Snowpark API is available in Python, Java, and Scala.",
        "Code execution environments:\u00a0Snowpark runtime environments support container images and Python, Java, and Scala code.",
        "You can execute custom Python code through Python user-defined functions (UDFs) or stored procedures for building data pipelines,\napps, and more. Python runtime environments have access to a package repository and package manager from Anaconda.",
        "Runtime environments are also available in Scala and Java.",

        "Objects in the API are either local references (or handles) or snapshots of state stored on Snowflake. In general, when you process\ninformation that was retrieved from Snowflake, you do so through a local, in-memory reference object.",
        "These references do not synchronize with Snowflake until you call a method. When you call a method, you are usually incurring costs in\nboth usage credit and network activity. In contrast, when you work with in-memory references, such as when accessing attributes, your work\nis performed locally and incurs no such costs.",
