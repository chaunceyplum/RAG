For example, you can split large objects across multiple columns or rows,\ntransform nested JSON into a tabular format, or simplify complex geometries.",

        "With this release, we are pleased to announce a new system function, SYSTEM$DATA_METRIC_SCAN, that returns records that failed a data\nquality check. Previously, you could use data metric functions to identify data quality issues but did not have the ability to pinpoint the\nrecords responsible for the problems.",
