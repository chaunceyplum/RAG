        "GET_DRIVERS is well-suited to extracting root causes from datasets that have a large number of dimensions. Continuous\ndimensions are also supported without pre-processing them into categorical dimensions, and the results can indicate\ndimensions with negative conditions (for example, \u201cregion is not North America\u201d).",

Numeric columns are\ntaken to be continuous dimensions, while string and Boolean columns are considered categorical dimensions. To treat a\nnumeric column as a categorical dimension, cast it to a string.",
