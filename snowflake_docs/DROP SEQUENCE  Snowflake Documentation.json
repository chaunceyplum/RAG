        "Snowflake allows the keywords CASCADE and RESTRICT syntactically, but does not act on them. For example,\ndropping a sequence with the CASCADE keyword does not actually drop a table that uses the sequence.\nDropping a sequence with the RESTRICT keyword does not issue a warning if a table is still using the sequence.",
        "To drop a sequence, you must be using a role that has ownership privilege on the sequence.",
        "After dropping a sequence, creating a sequence with the same name creates a new version of the sequence. The\nnew sequence does not resume generating numbers where the old sequence left off.",
        "Before dropping a sequence, verify that no tables or other database objects reference the sequence.",
        "If the dropped sequence was referenced in the DEFAULT clause of a table, then calling GET_DDL() for that\ntable results in an error, rather than in the DDL that created the table.",
