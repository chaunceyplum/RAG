        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "Not available in government regions.",
        "You can use Python to manage Snowflake dynamic tables, which are a new table type for continuous processing pipelines. Dynamic tables\nmaterialize the results of a specified query. For an overview of this feature, see Dynamic tables.",
        "The Snowflake Python APIs represents dynamic tables with two separate types:",
        "DynamicTable: Exposes a dynamic table\u2019s properties such as its name, target lag, warehouse, and query statement.",
        "DynamicTableResource: Exposes methods you can use to fetch a corresponding DynamicTable object, suspend and resume the\ndynamic table, and drop the dynamic table.",
        "Minimum API version required",
        "0.10.0",
        "The examples in this topic assume that you\u2019ve added code to connect with Snowflake and to create a Root object from which to use the\nSnowflake Python APIs.",
        "For example, the following code uses connection parameters defined in a configuration file to create a connection to Snowflake:",
        "Using the resulting Session object, the code creates a Root object to use the API\u2019s types and methods. For more information,\nsee Connect to Snowflake with the Snowflake Python APIs.",
        "To create a dynamic table, first create a DynamicTable object, and then create a DynamicTableCollection object from the API\nRoot object. Using DynamicTableCollection.create, add the new dynamic table to Snowflake.",
        "Code in the following example creates a DynamicTable object that represents a dynamic table named my_dynamic_table in the\nmy_db database and the my_schema schema, with the minimum required options specified:",
        "The code creates a DynamicTableCollection variable dynamic_tables and uses DynamicTableCollection.create to create\na new dynamic table in Snowflake.",
        "Code in the following example creates a DynamicTable object that represents a dynamic table named my_dynamic_table2 in the\nmy_db database and the my_schema schema with all currently possible options specified:",
        "Code in the following example creates a new dynamic table named my_dynamic_table2 with the same column definitions and all existing\ndata from the source dynamic table my_dynamic_table in the my_db database and the my_schema schema:",
        "Note",
        "This clone operation uses the DynamicTableClone object, which includes the optional target_lag and warehouse\nparameters, and currently does not support other parameters.",
        "For more information about this functionality, see CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE \u2026 CLONE.",
        "You can get information about a dynamic table by calling the DynamicTableResource.fetch method, which returns a\nDynamicTable object.",
        "Code in the following example gets information about a dynamic table named my_dynamic_table in the my_db database and the\nmy_schema schema:",
        "You can list dynamic tables using the DynamicTableCollection.iter method, which returns a PagedIter iterator of\nDynamicTable objects.",
        "Code in the following example lists dynamic tables whose name starts with the text my in the my_db database and the my_schema\nschema, and then prints the name of each:",
        "You can perform common dynamic table operations\u2014such as refreshing, suspending, and resuming a dynamic table\u2014with a\nDynamicTableResource object.",
        "To demonstrate some operations you can do with a dynamic table resource, code in the following example does the following:",
        "Gets the my_dynamic_table dynamic table resource object.",
        "Refreshes the dynamic table.",
        "Suspends the dynamic table.",
        "Resumes the dynamic table.",
        "Drops the dynamic table.",
