        "If g1 and g2 are different types of geospatial objects, or if at least one of the input GEOGRAPHY objects is a\ncollection (e.g. MultiLineString, GeometryCollection, or FeatureCollection), then the result is a GeometryCollection\ncontaining both input objects.",

        "This calls ST_COLLECT as an aggregate function to create a MultiPoint value that contains all the points in the\nsame column:",
        "This calls ST_COLLECT first as an aggregate function on each column to create MultiPoint values that contains all\nthe points in each column, and then calls ST_COLLECT on those two MultiPoint values to create a GeometryCollection\nthat contains all the points in both columns.
