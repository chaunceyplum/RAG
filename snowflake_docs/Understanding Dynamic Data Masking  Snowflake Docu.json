        "Enterprise Edition Feature",
        "This feature requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact Snowflake Support.",
        "This topic provides a general overview of the Dynamic Data Masking feature.",
        "To learn more about using a masking policy with a tag, see Tag-based masking policies.",
        "Dynamic Data Masking is a Column-level Security feature that uses masking policies to selectively mask plain-text data in table and view columns at query time.",
        "In Snowflake, masking policies are schema-level objects, which means a database and schema must exist in Snowflake before a masking policy can be applied to a column. Currently, Snowflake supports using Dynamic Data Masking on tables and views.",
        "At query runtime, the masking policy is applied to the column at every location where the column appears. Depending on the masking policy conditions, the SQL execution context, and role hierarchy, Snowflake query operators may see the plain-text value, a partially masked value, or a fully masked value.",
        "For more details about how masking policies work, including the query runtime behavior, creating a policy, usage with tables and views, and management approaches using masking policies, see: Understanding Column-level Security.",
        "For more details on the effects of the SQL execution context and role hierarchy, see Advanced Column-level Security topics.",
        "The following summarizes some of the key benefits of Dynamic Data Masking.",
        "You can write a policy once and have it apply to thousands of columns across databases and schemas.",
        "A security or privacy officer decides which columns to protect, not the object owner. Masking policies are easy to manage and support centralized and decentralized administration models.",
        "Contextual data access by role or custom entitlements.",
        "Supports data governance as implemented by security or privacy officers and can prohibit privileged users with the ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN role from unnecessarily viewing data.",
        "Easily mask data before sharing.",
        "Easily change masking policy content without having to reapply the masking policy to thousands of columns.",
        "For a comparison of benefits between Dynamic Data Masking and External Tokenization, see: Column-level Security Benefits.",
        "For an overview of the limitations, see Column-level Security Limitations.",
        "For additional Dynamic Data Masking Considerations, see Column-level Security Considerations.",
        "The following table summarizes the privileges related to Dynamic Data Masking.",
        "Privilege",
        "Usage",
        "CREATE",
        "Enables creating a new masking policy in a schema.",
        "APPLY",
        "Enables executing the unset and set operations for a masking policy on a column.",
        "Note that granting the global APPLY MASKING POLICY privilege (i.e. APPLY MASKING POLICY on ACCOUNT) enables executing the DESCRIBE\noperation on tables and views.",
        "For syntax examples, see Masking policy privileges.",
        "OWNERSHIP",
        "Grants full control over the masking policy. Required to alter most properties of a masking policy. Only a single role can hold this\nprivilege on a specific object at a time.",
        "Note",
        "Operating on a masking policy also requires the USAGE privilege on the parent database and schema.",
        "Snowflake provides the following set of commands to manage Dynamic Data Masking policies.",
        "CREATE MASKING POLICY",
        "ALTER MASKING POLICY (see also: ALTER TABLE, ALTER TABLE \u2026 ALTER COLUMN, and ALTER VIEW)",
        "DROP MASKING POLICY",
        "SHOW MASKING POLICIES",
        "DESCRIBE MASKING POLICY",
        "Snowflake provides two Account Usage views to obtain information about masking policies:",
        "The MASKING POLICIES view provides a list of all masking policies in your\nSnowflake account.",
        "The POLICY_REFERENCES view provides a list of all objects in which a masking\npolicy is set.",
        "The Information Schema table function POLICY_REFERENCES can be used to either:",
        "Return a list of all objects (i.e. tables, views) that have the masking policy set on a column.",
        "Return a list of policy associations that have the specified object name and object type.",
        "Snowflake records the original query run by the user on the History page (in the web interface). The query\nis found in the SQL Text column.",
        "The masking policy names that were used in a specific query can be found in the Query Profile.",
        "The query history is specific to the Account Usage QUERY_HISTORY view only. In this\nview, the Query Text column contains the text of the SQL statement. Masking policy names are not included in the QUERY_HISTORY\nview.",
        "You can use error messages to help troubleshoot masking policy issues.",
        "The following table describes error messages Snowflake can return while using masking policies.",
