        "You can use the SCIM group API to access, create, and modify roles.",
        "Snowflake uses SCIM to import roles from Okta, Azure AD and custom-built applications. The roles in these identity providers map one-to-one\nwith Snowflake roles.",
        "Roles, sometimes called groups, are a collection of access privileges. To access securable objects in Snowflake, privileges must be assigned\nto roles, and roles are assigned to other roles or users.",
        "Access permissions and rights that are granted to the role are automatically inherited by every member, such as a user, of the role. For\nmore information, see Overview of Access Control.",
        "A user\u2019s access requirements to Snowflake can change. For example, a user can change from being an individual contributor to a manager in\ntheir organization, which may require their role in Snowflake to change, or they may require access to data sets only available to managers.",
        "As the user\u2019s role changes in the identity provider, their access to Snowflake automatically changes when their organization role maps to the\ncorresponding Snowflake role.",
