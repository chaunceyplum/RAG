        "If you cannot sign in to Snowflake due to an MFA issue, for example, you don\u2019t have access to your phone, contact one of the account\nadministrators for your Snowflake account. They can temporarily disable MFA so that you can log in, or fully disable MFA for your user,\nwhich effectively cancels your enrollment.",
        "After you enroll in MFA, you cannot use Snowsight to disable MFA. Instead, an account administrator must use a SQL command to\ntemporarily or permanently disable MFA for you. For details, see Managing MFA for an account and users.",
