        "A forecast model produces a forecast for a single time series or for multiple time series. You use\nCREATE SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST to create and train the forecasting model, then use the model\u2019s\n<model_name>!FORECAST method to produce forecasts. The <model_name>!EXPLAIN_FEATURE_IMPORTANCE\nmethod provides information about how each feature in the training data influences the forecast. The\n<model_name>!SHOW_TRAINING_LOGS method provides error messages for any time series whose models failed to\nfit. The <model_name>!SHOW_EVALUATION_METRICS method provides evaluation metrics on out-of-sample data.",
