        "Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL\nwildcard characters (% and _).",
        "For example, the following patterns return the same results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Optionally specifies the scope of the command, which determines whether the command lists records only for the current/specified\ndatabase or schema, or across your entire account:",
        "The DATABASE or SCHEMA keyword is not required; you can set the scope by specifying only the database or schema name.\nLikewise, the database or schema name is not required if the session currently has a database in use:",
        "If DATABASE or SCHEMA is specified without a name and the session does not currently have a database in use, the\nparameter has no effect on the output.",
        "If SCHEMA is specified with a name and the session does not currently have a database in use, the schema name must\nbe fully qualified with the database name (e.g. testdb.testschema).",
        "Default: Depends on whether the session currently has a database in use:",
        "Database: DATABASE is the default (i.e. the command returns the objects you have privileges to view in the database).",
        "No database: ACCOUNT is the default (i.e. the command returns the objects you have privileges to view in your account).",
        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "For example, the following strings return different results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output)",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",
        "The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "The string does not have to include the full object name; partial names are supported.",
        "Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output)",
        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",
