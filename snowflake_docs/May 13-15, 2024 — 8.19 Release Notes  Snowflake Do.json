        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the preview of the serverless compute model for Snowflake alerts.",
        "When you configure an alert to use the serverless compute model, Snowflake automatically resizes and scales up or down the compute resources\nrequired for the alert. Snowflake determines the ideal size of the compute resources for a given run based on a dynamic analysis of\nstatistics for the most recent previous runs of the same alert.",
        "To use the serverless compute model for an alert, omit the WAREHOUSE parameter when executing the CREATE ALERT command.",
        "For more information, see Setting up alerts based on data in Snowflake.",

Additionally, if you decide to replace a CMK, the\nself-registration process informs you whether your new CMK is registered and activated. After you complete the self-registration process,\nyou can contact Snowflake Support to enable your Snowflake account to use Tri-Secret Secure.",
