        "A table function returns a set of rows for each input row. The returned set can contain zero, one, or more rows. Each row can\ncontain one or more columns.",
        "Table functions are sometimes called \u201ctabular functions\u201d.",
        "Table functions are typically used when a function returns multiple rows for each individual input.",
        "Each time that a table function is called, it can return a different number of rows. For example, a function\nrecord_high_temperatures_for_date(), which returns a list of record high temperatures for a specified date, might\nreturn 0 rows on April 10, 1 row on June 10, and 40 rows on August 20.",
        "The following are appropriate as table functions:",
        "A function that accepts an account number and a date, and returns all charges billed to that account on that date.\n(More than one charge might have been billed on a particular date.)",
        "A function that accepts a user ID and returns the database roles assigned to that user.\n(A user might have multiple roles, including \u201csysadmin\u201d and \u201cuseradmin\u201d.)",
        "Table functions can be grouped into two categories based on the number of input rows that affect each output row:",
        "1-to-N",
        "M-to-N",
        "The functions described earlier are 1-to-N table functions: each output row depends upon only one input row. For example, a\nfunction record_high_temperatures_for_date() might produce multiple output rows (one for each city that hit a record on\nthat date). Each output row for a specific input date depends only on that date; each output row is independent of the rows for\nevery other date.",
        "Snowflake also supports M-to-N table functions: each output row can depend upon multiple input rows. For example, if a function\ngenerates a moving average of stock prices, that function uses stock prices from multiple input rows (multiple dates) to generate\neach output row.",
        "More generally, in an M-to-N function, a group of M input rows produces a group of N output rows. M can be one or more rows.\nN can be zero, one, or more rows.",
        "For example, in a 10-day moving average, M is 10. N is 1 because each group of 10 input rows produces one average price.",
        "Snowflake provides hundreds of built-in functions, many of which are table functions. Built-in table functions are listed in\nSystem-Defined Table Functions.",
        "Users can also write their own functions, called user-defined functions or \u201cUDFs\u201d. Some UDFs are scalar; some are tabular.\nUser-defined table functions are called \u201cUDTFs\u201d. For information about UDFs (including UDTFs), refer to\nUser-defined functions overview.",
        "Built-in table functions and user-defined table functions generally follow the same rules; for example, they are called the same way\nfrom SQL statements.",
        "A table contains a set of rows. Similarly, a table function returns a set of rows. Both tables and table functions are used in\ncontexts that expect a set of rows. Specifically, table functions are used in the FROM clause of a\nSQL statement.",
        "To help the SQL compiler recognize a table function as a source of rows, Snowflake requires that the table function call be\nwrapped by the TABLE() keyword.",
        "For example, the following statement calls a table function named record_high_temperatures_for_date(), which takes a DATE\nvalue as an argument:",
        "For more information about the syntax of TABLE(), refer to Table literals.",
        "Table functions, like functions in general, can accept zero, one, or multiple input arguments in each invocation. Each argument\nmust be a scalar expression.",
        "For more details about the syntax of table function calls, refer to Syntax (in this topic).",
        "The argument to a table function can be a literal or an expression, such as a column of a table.\nFor example, the SELECT statement below passes values from a table as arguments to a table function:",
        "The arguments to a table function can come from other table-like sources, including views and other table functions.",
