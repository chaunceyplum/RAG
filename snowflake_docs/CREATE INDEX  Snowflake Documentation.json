        "Creates a new secondary index in an existing hybrid table and populates the index with data.",
        "The creation of an index is an online (non-blocking) operation. The hybrid table will remain available for SELECT and DML\nstatements while the index is being built. However, if the hybrid table is not in active use and downtime is not an issue, it is recommended that you recreate the hybrid table with indexes defined. See also Create hybrid tables.",
        "DROP INDEX , SHOW INDEXES , CREATE HYBRID TABLE , DROP TABLE , DESCRIBE TABLE , SHOW HYBRID TABLES",
        "Specifies the identifier for the new index. You must specify a unique name for each new index on a given hybrid table.\nNo other secondary index with either the same name or the same ordered set of columns can exist on the hybrid table.",
        "Specifies the name of an existing hybrid table that will hold the new index.",
        "Specifies the name of an existing column in the hybrid table. All the requirements for index columns defined at table creation\napply to column identifiers.",
        "A hybrid table cannot contain two secondary indexes defined on the same ordered set of columns.",
        "Columns with geospatial data types\n(GEOGRAPHY and GEOMETRY), semi-structured data types\n(ARRAY, OBJECT, VARIANT), and vector data types (VECTOR) are not supported in secondary indexes.",
        "To create an index, you must use a role that has OWNERSHIP privilege on the hybrid table.",
        "The CREATE INDEX command cannot be used to add a foreign, primary, or unique key constraint.",
        "The creation of a new index does not concurrently block other workloads. The hybrid table is available for concurrent SELECT\nand DML statements.",
        "Only one active index build operation per hybrid table can run at any time.",
        "You can track the progress of an index build by using SHOW INDEXES. The STATUS column can take the following values:",
        "ACTIVE: Index is complete and can be used to retrieve data.",
        "SUSPENDED: Index is only updated and is not used to retrieve data.",
        "BUILD FAILURE: An error has occurred with the index build process. You need to drop and recreate the index.",
        "BUILD IN PROGRESS: Index is being built and is not used to retrieve data.",
        "You can rebuild a non-active index, where the status is SUSPENDED, BUILD FAILURE, or BUILD IN PROGRESS, by using DROP INDEX\nand CREATE INDEX.",
        "If you want to drop a column that is part of an index that is being built, first stop the index build by dropping the index, then\ndrop the column. If you try to drop the column before dropping the index, you will receive this error message:",
        "Online index builds do not make progress until all the active transactions with DMLs on the same table at the time when the\nCREATE INDEX statement was issued are completed. If any of those transactions remain idle for more than 5 minutes, they will\nabort by default. See Transactions.",
        "During the index build process, any DML performs its writes to the new index, but does not use the index to retrieve data.",
        "A small number of concurrent DMLs, which began executing after the CREATE INDEX command was complete, may fail and return\nthis error:",
        "If the aborted DML statements belong to a multi-statement transaction, the transaction will roll back only if the\nTRANSACTION_ABORT_ON_ERROR parameter is set to TRUE.",
        "A newly created index will be used for retrieving data only when the index build process concludes successfully and the\nstatus of the index is ACTIVE.",
        "To run the following CREATE INDEX example, first create and load the hybrid table.",
        "Now you can create an index on the table.",
        "If a failure occurs while the index is being built, the SHOW INDEXES command reports the following status:",
        "If you decide to stop the index build, use a DROP INDEX command:",
