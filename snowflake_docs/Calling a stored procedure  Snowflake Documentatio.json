    "paragraphs": [
        "You can call a stored procedure using the SQL CALL command.",
        "In order for a user to call a stored procedure, the user\u2019s role must have the\nUSAGE privilege for the stored procedure.",
        "Once you have the privileges to call the stored procedure, you can use a CALL statement to call the stored procedure.",
        "Note",
        "To both create and call an anonymous procedure, use CALL (with anonymous procedure). Creating and calling an anonymous procedure does\nnot require a role with CREATE PROCEDURE schema privileges.",
        "If the stored procedure has arguments, you can specify those arguments by name or by position.",
        "For example, the following stored procedure accepts three arguments:",
        "When calling the procedure, you can specify the arguments by name:",
        "If you specify the arguments by name, you do not need to specify the arguments in any particular order:",
        "You can also specify the arguments by position:",
        "Note the following:",
        "You must either specify all arguments by name or by position. You cannot specify some of the arguments by name and other\narguments by position.",
        "When specifying an argument by name, you cannot use double quotes around the argument name.",
        "If two functions or two procedures have the same name but different argument types, you can use the argument names to specify\nwhich function or procedure to execute, if the argument names are different. Refer to\nOverloading procedures and functions.",
        "If the stored procedure has optional arguments, you can omit the optional\narguments in the call. Each optional argument has a default value that is used when the argument is omitted.",
        "For example, the following stored procedure has one required argument and two optional arguments. Each optional argument has a\ndefault value.",
        "You can omit any of the optional arguments in the call. When you omit an argument, the default value of the argument is used.",
        "If you need to omit an optional argument and specify another optional argument that appears after the omitted argument in the\nsignature, use named arguments, rather than positional arguments.",
        "For example, suppose that you want to omit the prefix argument and specify the suffix argument. The suffix argument\nappears after the prefix in the signature, so you must specify the arguments by name:",
        "To execute a stored procedure, use a CALL statement. For example:",
        "Each argument to a stored procedure can be a general expression:",
        "An argument can be a subquery:",
        "You can call only one stored procedure per CALL statement. For example, the following statement fails:",
        "Also, you cannot use a stored procedure CALL as part of an expression. For example, all the following statements fail:",
        "However, inside a stored procedure, the stored procedure can call\nanother stored procedure, or call itself recursively.",
        "Caution",
        "Nested calls can exceed the maximum allowed stack depth, so be careful when nesting calls,\nespecially when using recursion.",
