        "This table function can be used to query the history of data loaded into Snowflake tables using Snowpipe within a specified date range. The function returns the history of data loaded and credits billed for your entire Snowflake account.",

        "If an end date is not specified, then CURRENT_DATE is used as the end of the range.",
        "If a start date is not specified, then the range starts 10 minutes prior to the start of DATE_RANGE_END (i.e. the\ndefault is to show the previous 10 minutes of data load history). For example,\nif DATE_RANGE_END is CURRENT_DATE, then the default DATE_RANGE_START is 11:50 PM on the previous day.",
        "History is displayed in increments of 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 24 hours (depending on the length of the specified range).",

        "When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use or the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see\nSnowflake Information Schema.",
        "Occasionally, the data compaction and maintenance process can consume Snowflake credits. For example, the returned results might show that you consumed credits with 0 BYTES_INSERTED and 0 FILES_INSERTED. This means that your data is not being loaded, but the data compaction and maintenance process has consumed some credits.",
        "Snowflake bills for auto-refresh notifications in external tables and directory tables on external stages at\na rate equivalent to the Snowpipe file charge. You can estimate charges incurred by your external table and directory table auto-refresh\nnotifications by querying the PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY function or examining the Account Usage PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY view. Note that the auto-refresh pipes will be listed under a NULL pipe\nname. You can also view your external table auto-refresh notification history at the table-level/stage-level granularity by using the\nInformation Schema table function AUTO_REFRESH_REGISTRATION_HISTORY.",
        "To avoid charges for auto-refresh notifications, perform a manual refresh for external tables and directory tables. For external tables, the\nALTER EXTERNAL TABLE <name> REFRESH \u2026 statement can be used to manually synchronize your external table to external storage. For directory\ntables, the ALTER STAGE <name> REFRESH \u2026 statement can be used to manually synchronize the directory to external storage.",
