        "Note that the functions STDDEV and STDDEV_SAMP do not return the same result as STDDEV_POP.",
        "The following example assumes that you have a table named menu that lists food items for sale in a cafe.\nThe following output shows the 6 rows in the table that belong to the Dessert category. Other rows also exist\nfor other categories, such as Main and Beverage.",
        "To find the population standard deviation for the cost of goods sold and the sale price (for the Dessert rows\nonly), run this query:",
        "The following example uses the same menu table but runs the STDDEV_POP function as a window function.",
        "The window function partitions rows by the item_category column. Therefore, the standard deviation is\ncalculated once for each item category, and that value is repeated in the result for each row in the group.\nIn this example, the rows must be grouped by both the item category and the cost of goods sold.\n(Note that the 6 Dessert rows are now grouped into 5 rows because two rows have the same cost of goods value.)",
