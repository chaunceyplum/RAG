        "Snowflake offers multiple editions to choose from, ensuring that your usage fits your organization\u2019s specific requirements. Each successive\nedition builds on the previous edition through the addition of edition-specific features and/or higher levels of service. As your\norganization\u2019s needs change and grow, changing editions is easy.",
        "For information about working with editions, including viewing and changing an account\u2019s edition, see Working with account editions.",
        "Note",
        "The Snowflake Edition that your organization chooses determines the unit costs for the credits and the data storage you use. Other factors\nthat impact unit costs are the region where your Snowflake account is located and whether it is\nan On Demand or Capacity account:",
        "On Demand: Usage-based pricing with no long-term licensing requirements.",
        "Capacity: Discounted pricing based on an upfront Capacity commitment.",
        "For pricing details, see the pricing page (on the Snowflake website).",
        "Standard Edition is our introductory level offering, providing full, unlimited access to all of Snowflake\u2019s standard features. It provides\na strong balance between features, level of support, and cost.",
        "Enterprise Edition provides all the features and services of Standard Edition, with additional features designed\nspecifically for the needs of large-scale enterprises and organizations.",
        "Business Critical Edition, formerly known as Enterprise for Sensitive Data (ESD), offers even higher levels of data protection to support\nthe needs of organizations with extremely sensitive data, particularly PHI data that must comply with HIPAA and\nHITRUST CSF regulations.",
        "It includes all the features and services of Enterprise Edition, with the addition of enhanced security and data\nprotection. In addition, database failover/failback adds support for business continuity and disaster recovery.",
        "Note",
        "As required by HIPAA and HITRUST CSF regulations, before any PHI data can be stored in Snowflake, a\nsigned business associate agreement (BAA) must be in place between your agency/organization and Snowflake Inc.",
        "Virtual Private Snowflake offers our highest level of security for organizations that have the strictest requirements, such as financial\ninstitutions and any other large enterprises that collect, analyze, and share highly sensitive data.",
        "It includes all the features and services of Business Critical Edition, but in a completely separate Snowflake\nenvironment, isolated from all other Snowflake accounts (i.e. VPS accounts do not share any type of hardware resources with accounts outside the VPS).",
        "Note",
        "To access your account, you can use an account identifier that specifies your\norganization name and account name.",
        "If you instead choose to use an account locator as the account identifier, note that\nthe account locator for VPS accounts uses a different format than the accounts for other Snowflake Editions. For details, see\nFinding the account locator format for a VPS account.",
