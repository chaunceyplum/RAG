        "An expression that evaluates to a BOOLEAN.",
        "A statement can be any of the following:",

        "A control-flow statement (for example, a looping or\nbranching statement).",
        "A nested block.",
        "An optional label. Such a label can be a jump target for a BREAK or\nCONTINUE statement. A label must follow the naming rules for\nObject identifiers.",
        "Put parentheses around the condition in the WHILE. For example: WHILE ( <condition> ).",
        "If the condition never evaluates to FALSE, and the loop doesn\u2019t contain a\nBREAK (Snowflake Scripting) command (or equivalent), then the loop will run and consume credits\nindefinitely.",
        "If the condition is NULL, then it is treated as FALSE.",
        "A loop can contain multiple statements. You can use, but are not required to use, a BEGIN \u2026 END\nblock to contain those statements.",
        "Pair the keyword DO with END WHILE, and pair the keyword LOOP with END LOOP.\nFor example:",
        "This example uses a loop to calculate a power of 2. The counter variable is the loop counter. The\npower_of_2 variable stores the most recent power of 2 that was calculated. (This is an inefficient\nsolution, but it demonstrates looping.)",
        "Call the stored procedure:",
        "This example uses a loop and the DATEADD function to add a day to a date\nuntil the condition is met.",
