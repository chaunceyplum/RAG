        "Snowflake Data Clean Rooms do not currently support data subject consent management. Customers are responsible for ensuring they have\nobtained all necessary rights and consents to use the data linked in their clean rooms. Customers must also ensure compliance with all\napplicable laws and regulations when using Data Clean Rooms, including in connection with third-party connectors.",
        "Data analyzed in a Snowflake Data Clean Room can be native to Snowflake, reside externally\nin cloud provider storage, or both. A connector allows collaborators to access external data from a cloud provider from within the clean\nroom.",
        "The external data connector uses Snowflake external tables to make data\navailable. Be aware that there is an increased security risk associated with linking external tables in a clean room. As a result,\nthe provider must explicitly allow the use of external tables in the clean room before\nconsumers can use a connector to include external data. If the provider uses the external data connector, the consumer is warned that\nexternal tables are being used so they can decide whether to install the clean room.",
        "This topic describes how to use a connector so that clean room analysts can access external data from an Amazon S3 bucket.",

        "The process of allowing clean room collaborators to access data from Amazon S3 storage consists of the following steps:",

        "In the clean room environment, authenticate the connector with AWS.",
        "Snowflake recommends that you create a dedicated IAM policy for the connector that includes the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket. In a\nsubsequent step, you add this policy to an IAM role that represents the identity of the connector.",
        "To complete this procedure, you need to know the region of the account associated with the clean room environment.",
