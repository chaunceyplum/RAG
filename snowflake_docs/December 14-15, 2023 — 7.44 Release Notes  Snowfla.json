        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of the Snowflake Cortex ML-Based functions\nForecasting (SNOWFLAKE.ML.FORECAST) and Anomaly Detection (SNOWFLAKE.ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION), which were previously\navailable as preview features. These functions use a machine learning model trained on your historical data to make\npredictions and detect unexpected events. You can also obtain evaluation metrics and feature importance data for these\nmodels to learn what factors are driving trends and causing anomalies.",
        "For more information, see Forecasting and\nAnomaly Detection.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of the Snowpark ML Modeling API, which was\npreviously available as a preview feature. Snowpark ML Modeling lets you train Python models inside Snowflake using APIs similar to those provided by Scikit-Learn,\nLightGBM, and XGBoost. Many preprocessing classes run in distributed fashion, on as many nodes as are available in\nyour warehouse, cutting runtime significantly.",
        "This feature is available in Snowpark ML 1.1.1 and later. For more information, see\nSnowpark ML Modeling.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the preview of distributed hyperparameter optimization in the\nSnowpark ML Modeling API. Hyperparameter optimization allows you to find the best parameters for your models and can now be run in\ndistributed fashion, cutting runtime significantly. Distributed processing is enabled by default, but may be disabled.",
        "This feature is available in Snowpark ML 1.1.1 and later. For more information, see\nSnowpark ML Modeling.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce cross-cloud/cross-region support for Apache Iceberg\u2122 tables in Snowflake that use an external Iceberg catalog.",
