        "Window functions (General)",
        "Returns a window event number for each row within a window partition based on the result of the boolean argument\nexpr1. The number starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 for each row on which the expr1 evaluates\nto true.",
        "One use of this function is to sessionize window partitions. For example, in click stream data, it can be used to\ndetermine whether a user has started a new session by checking whether the last event was longer ago than a threshold.",
        "This is a boolean expression that changes the window event number value when it evaluates true.",
        "This is the optional expression to partition by.",
        "This is the expression to order by within each partition.",
        "The conditional expression expr1 can contain the rank-related functions LAG and LEAD, which allow us to build\nmore expressive windows. If used, these functions have to use the same OVER specification as the\nCONDITIONAL_TRUE_EVENT.",
        "The first example illustrates that:",
        "The number within a partition increments each time the specified column is TRUE (non-zero in this case).",
        "NULL values are not considered a TRUE value.",
        "The number starts over at 0 for each partition.",
        "Create and load the table:",
        "Query the table:",
        "The next example shows that:",
        "expr1 can be an expression other than a column. This query uses the expression o_col > 20,\nand the output of the query shows when the value in o_col changes from a value less than or equal to 20\nto a value greater than 20.",
        "expr3 does not need to match expr1.  In other words, the expression in the ORDER BY\nsub-clause of the OVER clause does not need to match the expression in the CONDITIONAL_TRUE_EVENT function.",
        "Query the table:",
        "The next example compares CONDITIONAL_CHANGE_EVENT and CONDITIONAL_TRUE_EVENT:",
        "This example also compares CONDITIONAL_CHANGE_EVENT and CONDITIONAL_TRUE_EVENT:",
