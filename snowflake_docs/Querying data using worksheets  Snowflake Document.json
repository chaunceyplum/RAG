        "After you open a worksheet, you can write SQL queries and statements.",
        "Note",
        "Multiple SQL statements in a single API call are not supported. Ensure that each SQL query in the worksheet ends with a single\nsemicolon (;).",
        "When you set a database and optionally, a database schema, as the worksheet context, you can reference objects in the schema\nwithout fully qualifying the object names in your query.",

        "Values that match table or column names within a schema.",
        "Select a function to view its syntax and a brief description.",
        "Snowflake tracks table aliases and suggests them as autocomplete options. For example, if you execute a query using posts as p or\nposts p as an alias, the next time you type p, the autocomplete feature suggests the alias as an option.",
        "Snowflake Copilot is an LLM-powered assistant that simplifies data analysis. You can use natural language requests to explore a new dataset,\ngenerate queries or refine existing queries.",

        "Using the Databases explorer, you can pin databases and database objects for quick reference. When you hover over a database object,\nselect the Pin icon to pin them. Pinned objects appear at the top of the Databases explorer in the Pinned section.\nYou might need to expand the section to view of all your pinned objects.",

        "When you create a worksheet inside a folder, the worksheet is created with the role of your current session.",
        "Note",
        "To run a worksheet in a folder that was shared with you, even if you have View and Run or Edit permissions on the folder,\nyou must use the same role as the worksheet. If you do not have the same role, duplicate the worksheet and run it as one of your own roles.",

        "Note that some column transformation activities performed on the query results of Snowsight worksheets incur\ncompute cost. The compute cost is billed against the same warehouse used to run the query.",
        "For example, when you sort a column by ascending or descending order using the column options, the changes affect all of your results,\ninstead of just the first 10,000 rows returned, and you incur compute cost.",

        "After you run SQL in a worksheet, you can review the history of queries run in the worksheet, for example to compare results of different\nquery runs. You must use the same role as the worksheet to view the query history for the worksheet.",
        "When the Results pane is visible, select  (Query history) to review the queries that have been\nrun in the worksheet, as well as the results for those queries.\nThe history includes up to 25 queries run in that worksheet during your current session and previous sessions over the last 14 days.",
