        "For queries that use conjunctions of predicates (i.e., AND), query performance can be improved by search optimization if\nany of the predicates would benefit.",
        "For example, suppose that a query has:",
        "where condition_x and condition_y",
        "Search optimization can improve performance if either condition separately returns a few rows (i.e., condition_x\nreturns a few rows or condition_y returns a few rows).",
        "If condition_x returns a few rows but condition_y returns many rows, the query performance can still\nbenefit from search optimization.",
        "If predicates are individually supported by the search optimization service, then they can be joined by the conjunction\nAND and still be supported by the search optimization service:",
        "DELETE and UPDATE (and MERGE) can also use the search optimization service:",

        "For example, suppose that a query has:",
        "where condition_x or condition_y",

        "In the case of disjunctions, each predicate in isolation is not decisive in the query. All predicates must be evaluated\nto determine whether search optimization can improve performance.",
