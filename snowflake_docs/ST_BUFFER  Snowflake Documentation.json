        "Returns a GEOMETRY object that represents a MultiPolygon containing\nthe points within a specified distance of the input GEOMETRY object. The returned object effectively\nrepresents a \u201cbuffer\u201d around the input object.",

        "The distance from the GEOMETRY object. To \u201cshrink\u201d the object, you can specify a negative value for the distance.",
        "The units depend on the spatial reference system identifier (SRID) of the GEOMETRY object. For example,\nESPG:4326 units are degrees, while ESPG:25855\nunits are meters.",
        "Returns a GEOMETRY object.",
        "SRIDs are based on the EPSG standard (v10.082). For example, the SRID 4326 corresponds to the authority EPSG with the code\n4326.",

        "If distance is a negative value, the returned object is smaller than the input object. You can use this to\nremove small irregularities from the shape.",
        "For LineStrings, the endcap and join styles are always round.",
        "LineStings are always buffered on both sides.",

        "The following example uses a negative value for distance to remove small irregularities (such as spikes) from the shape.\nThe TO_GEOMETRY call passes in TRUE as the second argument, which allows the function to create a GEOMETRY\nobject for an invalid shape.",
