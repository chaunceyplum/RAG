        "If the function is called as a window function, the window can include an optional window_frame.\nThe window_frame (either cumulative or sliding) specifies the subset of rows within the window for which\nthe summed values are returned.

        "Use a PARTITION BY clause to break the data into groups based on the\nvalue of k. This is similar to, but not identical to, using\nGROUP BY. In particular, GROUP BY produces one output\nrow per group, while  PARTITION BY produces one output row per input\nrow.",
        "Use a windowing ORDER BY clause to create a sliding window two rows wide,\nand output the highest value within that window. (Remember that ORDER BY in\nthe windowing clause is separate from ORDER BY at the statement level.)\nThis example uses a single partition, so there is no PARTITION BY clause\nin the OVER() clause.",
