        "Additional authenticated data (AAD) is additional data whose confidentiality and authenticity is assured during the\ndecryption process. However, this AAD is not encrypted and is not included as a field in the returned value from the\nENCRYPT or ENCRYPT_RAW function.",
        "If AAD is passed to the encryption function (ENCRYPT or ENCRYPT_RAW), then the same AAD must be passed to the\ndecryption function (DECRYPT or DECRYPT_RAW). If the AAD passed to the decryption function does not match the\nAAD passed to the encryption function, then decryption fails.",
        "The difference between the AAD and the passphrase is that the passphrase is intended to be kept\nsecret (otherwise, the encryption is essentially worthless) while the AAD can be left public. The AAD helps\nauthenticate that a public piece of information and an encrypted value are associated with each other. The\nexamples section in the ENCRYPT function includes an example showing the behavior\nwhen the AAD matches and the behavior when it doesn\u2019t match.",
        "For ENCRYPT_RAW and DECRYPT_RAW, the data type of the AAD should be BINARY.\nFor ENCRYPT and DECRYPT, the data type of the AAD can be either VARCHAR or BINARY, and does not need to match\nthe data type of the value that was encrypted.",

        "The data type of the returned value is BINARY.",
        "Although only a single value is returned, that value contains two or three concatenated fields:",
        "The first field is an initialization vector (IV). The IV is generated randomly using a CTR-DRBG random number\ngenerator. Both encryption and decryption use the IV.",
        "The second field is the ciphertext (encrypted value) of the value_to_encrypt.",

        "The passphrase can be of arbitrary length, even 0 (the empty string). However, Snowflake\nstrongly recommends using a passphrase that is at least 8 bytes.",
        "Snowflake recommends that the passphrase follow general best practices for passwords, such as using a mix of\nuppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation.",
        "The passphrase is not used directly to encrypt/decrypt the input. Instead, the passphrase is used to derive an\nencryption/decryption key, which is always the same for the same passphrase. Snowflake uses the\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2 key-derivation function with a Snowflake-internal seed to compute the\nencryption/decryption key from the given passphrase.",
