        "We are pleased to announce that the Time-Series Forecasting ML Function now includes preprocessing features that allow\nyou to successfully train a forecasting model even when your training data has missing, duplicate, or misaligned time\nsteps. In the past, such issues, which are common in real-world data, typically prevented the model from being trained.\nThese features are:",
        "You can manually specify an event cadence in case the model fails to infer it or infers it incorrectly",
        "The model can interpolate missing target values from nearby time steps.",
        "The model can aggregate dimensional values from events occurring outside the canonical event cadence in a number of\nways, and you can specify aggregation behaviors for the type of value or per column.",
        "A relatively small number of such corrections does not noticeably affect prediction accuracy.",
