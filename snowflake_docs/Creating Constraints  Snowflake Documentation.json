        "A constraint can be created at table creation using CREATE TABLE, or added to a table later using ALTER TABLE:",
        "Single-column constraints can be created inline as part of the column definition.",
        "Multi-column constraints must be created in a separate, i.e. out-of-line, clause that specifies the columns in the constraint.",
        "To create a constraint, certain access control privileges must be granted on the role used to create the constraint. For more information, see Access control requirements.",
        "The following inline syntax can only be used for single-column constraints:",
        "For inline_constraint syntax details, see CREATE | ALTER TABLE \u2026 CONSTRAINT.",
        "The following out-of-line syntax must be used for multi-column constraints, but can also be used for single-column constraints:",
        "For outofline_constraint syntax details, see CREATE | ALTER TABLE \u2026 CONSTRAINT.",
        "Snowflake supports creating copies of tables using CREATE TABLE:",
        "To create an empty copy, use CREATE TABLE \u2026 LIKE.",
        "To create a clone, use CREATE TABLE \u2026 CLONE.",
        "In addition, copies of tables are automatically created when a schema or database is cloned.",
        "Regardless of how a copy is created for a table, the constraints on the original table are also copied. When copying a foreign key with a referencing table (foreign key table) and a referenced table (primary key table), the following scenarios may occur:",
        "If both tables are copied in the same command (such as during cloning of a schema or database), a new foreign key is created between the new referencing table and the referenced table.",
        "If only the referencing table is copied, a new foreign key is created on the referencing table, which points to the original primary key table as the referenced table.",
        "If only the referenced table is copied, no new foreign keys are created, although the primary/unique keys are copied.",
        "As a result, if you copy a referencing and referenced table separately, you must manually create a new foreign key, or change the primary key table for the new foreign key manually.",
