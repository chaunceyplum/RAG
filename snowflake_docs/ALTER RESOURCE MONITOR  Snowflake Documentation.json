        "Where:",
        "Specifies the identifier for the resource monitor to alter. If the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire string must be\nenclosed in double quotes. Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "Specifies the number of credits allocated to the resource monitor per frequency interval. When total usage for all warehouses assigned to\nthe monitor reaches this number for the current frequency interval, the resource monitor is considered to be at 100% of quota.",
        "If a value is not specified for a resource monitor, the monitor has no quota and will never reach 100% usage within the specified interval.",
        "The frequency interval at which the credit usage resets to 0.",
        "If you specify NEVER for the frequency, the credit usage for the warehouse does not reset.",
        "The date and time when the resource monitor starts monitoring credit usage for the assigned warehouses.",
        "If you specify IMMEDIATELY for the start timestamp, the current timestamp is used.",
        "If you specify a date without a time, the current time is used.",
        "If you set a time without specifying a time zone, UTC is used as the default time zone.",
        "The date and time when the resource monitor suspends the assigned warehouses.",
        "Specifies the list of users to receive email notifications on resource monitors. If a user identifier includes spaces or special\ncharacters or is case-sensitive, then the identifier must be enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \u201cMary Smith\u201d). See\nIdentifier requirements for details.",
        "The user identifier, user_name, is the value of the name column from the output of\nSHOW USERS.",
        "Each user listed must have a verified email address. For instructions on verifying email addresses in the web interface, see:",

        "For Snowsight: Verify your email address.",
        "Email notifications for non-administrator users do not supersede email notifications for administrators. Any account administrators that\nhave enabled email notifications will continue to receive email notifications.",

        "DO SUSPEND | SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE | NOTIFY (action to perform when the threshold is reached).",
        "For more details, see CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR.",
        "If a SUSPEND or SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE trigger is active for a resource monitor and the trigger threshold has been reached for\nthe specified frequency interval, thereby preventing all assigned warehouses from being started/resumed, you can use this command to\neither increase the credit quota above the trigger threshold or replace the trigger with a new trigger with a higher threshold.",
        "Once the credit quota or trigger threshold for the resource monitor has been increased, assigned warehouses can be started or resumed.",
        "The TRIGGERS parameter is not additive (i.e. it removes all existing triggers for the resource monitor and replaces them\nwith the specified triggers).",
        "As a result, to make additions to the existing triggers, you must specify the new triggers and replicate the existing triggers.",
        "If frequency and start_timestamp parameters are set on a resource monitor, the day for the credit usage reset is\ncalculated based on those parameters. The time the credit usage resets to 0 is 12:00 AM UTC regardless of the time specified in\nstart_timestamp.",
        "If you specify an end_timestamp, monitoring ends at that specified date and time and all assigned warehouses are suspended\nat that date and time even if the credit quota has not been reached.",
        "When this occurs, a notification is sent that states the resource monitor has reached a percentage of its quota and has triggered a\nsuspend immediate action. The percentage of the quota reflects the number of credits used in the current interval up to the end date\nand might not be a threshold you specified.",
        "If there are non-administrator users in the notification list, the following notes apply:",
        "If any user in the notification list does not have a verified email,\nthe SQL statement fails.",
        "If any user in the notification list changes their email address and does not verify the new email address, the\nnotification silently fails.",
        "The notification list is limited to a maximum number of 5 non-administrator users.",
        "Account administrators can view the notification list of non-administrator users in the output of\nSHOW RESOURCE MONITORS in the notify_user column.",

        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",

        "Alter a resource monitor to send notifications to three users when 80% of the credit quota is reached. In this example, the\nuser_name for two of the users includes a space and is therefore enclosed in double quotes:",
