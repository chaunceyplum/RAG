        "When attempting to load data from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, you could encounter the following error:",
        "This error indicates a violation of restrictions established for a GCP service perimeter, which is configured using VPC Service Controls to secure sensitive data. Although the GCS service account created for your Snowflake account may have been granted permission to read and write to the bucket, the access rules for the service perimeter are applied at the GCP organization level, potentially affecting multiple projects. To review additional details associated with the error message, access the VPC Service Control error logs. See the GCP documentation for descriptions of the violationReason values in the logs.",
        "The simplest option to resolve the error is to load data from a bucket that is excluded from the service perimeter. If that option is not allowed by your established security rules, you could exclude the GCS service account for your Snowflake account from the service perimeter filters by adding the service account in an access level policy. Note that the service account still requires access to approved resources using the standard IAM policy described in the instructions for configuring the integration with GCS.",
        "The access policy for a GCP organization contains access levels. Access levels are created and managed using the Access Context Manager and either the Google Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, or the Cloud API. The following instructions rely on the gcloud command-line tool.",
        "To add the GCS service account for your Snowflake account to an access level policy:",
        "Using a Snowflake client, retrieve the ID for the Cloud Storage service account that was created automatically for your Snowflake account (using DESCRIBE INTEGRATION):",
        "Where integration_name is the name of a storage integration in your account. For more information, see Configuring an integration for Google Cloud Storage.",
        "Create a file named snowflake_policy.yaml on your local machine. Specify the service account ID in the members attribute:",
