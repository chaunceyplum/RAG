        "By default, Snowflake restricts network traffic requests from external endpoints. In order to access external endpoints, you need to create\nan external network access integration. This topic describes\nhow you can set up external network access for your notebook.",
        "External access integrations and their underlying network rules must be created by an organization administrator.",
        "To create an external access integration for notebooks, do the following:",
        "Create a network rule that defines a set of IP addresses or domains using the CREATE NETWORK RULE command.",

        "Only an ACCOUNTADMIN or a role with the privilege to create EAIs can set them up for specific external endpoints. For information on\nthe required privileges, see Access control requirements.",

        "It is important to grant the USAGE privilege on the integration to the role that creates the notebooks. USAGE granted to the PUBLIC role\nwill not work. For detailed syntax, see external network access.",

        "In most cases, APIs require an API key. To allow external access, use SQL to associate a secret (such as the API key) with your notebook.\nTo manually associate a secret with a notebook, use the ALTER NOTEBOOK \u2026 SET SECRETS command:",
