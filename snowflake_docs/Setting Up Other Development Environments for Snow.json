        "If you are using a development environment not covered earlier (see Setting Up Your Development Environment for Snowpark Scala), see the instructions in this topic for\nconfiguring your environment to use Snowpark.",
        "To integrate the Snowpark library into a project that uses an sbt build file, add the library as a dependency.",
        "In the build.sbt file for your project, make the following changes:",
        "If the scalaVersion setting does not match the version that you plan to use, update the setting. For example:",
        "Note that you must use a\nScala version that is supported for use with the Snowpark library.",
        "Add the Snowpark library to the list of dependencies. For example:",
        "To integrate the Snowpark library into a Maven project, add the library as a dependency to your pom.xml file. For example:",
        "Set the <version> tag to the version of the library that you want to use. Note that version 1.15.0 is\nused in this example for illustration purposes only. The latest available version of the driver may be higher.",
        "If you are not using sbt or Maven to manage the dependencies for your application and you need a copy of the Snowpark library and\nits dependencies, you can download a TAR archive file or a zip file that contains the JAR files for the library and all of\nits dependencies. The TAR/ZIP archive includes the API reference documentation in scaladoc format.",
        "To download the Snowpark library:",
        "Go to the Snowpark Client Download page, and find the version that you want to use.",
        "Browse to the directory for the version that you want to use.",
        "The rest of the steps use 1.15.0 as an example.",
        "Download the snowpark-1.15.0-bundle.tar.gz (or .zip) file.",
        "Note",
        "As of Snowpark 0.9.0, rather than downloading an archive file that contains the Snowpark library and its dependencies in\nseparate JAR files, you can choose to download a single JAR file that contains the Snowpark library and its dependencies.\nThis JAR file is named snowpark-1.15.0-with-dependencies.jar.",
        "If you download this JAR file, skip the rest of the steps. (The steps apply to the archive file.)",
        "If you want to verify the signature of the file:",
        "Download the snowpark-1.15.0-bundle.tar.gz.asc file.",
        "From the public keyserver, download and import the Snowflake GPG public key for the version of the library that you are\nusing:",
        "For version 1.15.0 and higher:",
        "For version 1.6.1 through 1.14.0:",
        "For version 0.6.0 through 1.6.0:",
        "Note",
        "If this command fails with the following error:",
        "then specify that you want to use port 80 for the keyserver:",
        "Run the gpg --verify command to verify the signature. For example:",
        "The output of the command should indicate that the archive file was signed with this key.",
        "Note",
        "Verifying the signature produces a warning similar to the following:",
        "To avoid the warning, you can grant the Snowflake GPG public key implicit trust.",
        "Extract the contents of the archive file.",
        "The README.txt file in the archive file describes the contents of each directory.",
        "Add the following extracted file and directory to the classpath for building and running your application:",
        "The snowpark-1.15.0.jar file",
        "The lib directory",
