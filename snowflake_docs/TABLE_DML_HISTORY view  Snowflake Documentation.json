        "This Account Usage view can be used to determine the magnitude and effects of the DML operations performed on a table. Note that\nthese DML operations include ones initiated by Snowpipe but exclude operations initiated\nby background maintenance services\n(for example, Automatic Clustering, maintenance for materialized views and\nsearch optimization).",
        "You can query this view with the QUERY_HISTORY view and the\nLOAD_HISTORY view to identify the DML operations that have a significant impact. This can\nhelp you to identify opportunities for optimization.",
        "In addition, you can query this view with the AUTOMATIC_CLUSTERING_HISTORY view and the\nSEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_HISTORY view to visualize the relationship between these DML operations and the\ncredits charged for Automatic Clustering and the search optimization service. (These services can be triggered by DML operations.)",
