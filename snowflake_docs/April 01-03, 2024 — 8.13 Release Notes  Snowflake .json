        "With this release, we are pleased to introduce training-time evaluation metrics for Anomaly Detection, a member of the\nSnowflake Cortex ML Functions suite, similar to those supported for the\nForecasting and Classification ML Functions. The Forecasting and Anomaly Detection functions can now also calculate\nevaluation metrics on new data, so that you can easily compare forecasts to actual observations. These tools allow you\nto easily determine how well the model predicts real data. For more information, see:",

        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the public preview of access to Git repositories from within Snowflake. After you configure Snowflake to act as a client of your Git repository, you can fetch a full clone of your remote repository to a Snowflake repository stage, which represents a local repository. You can reference these fetched files in procedure and function handler code, execute SQL and Python code in Snowflake, copy file contents into Snowflake worksheets, and more.",
