        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the availability of cross-region inferencing for Snowflake AI & ML features. A new\nparameter enables processing inference requests in a different region if the request cannot be processed in the region where the inference\nis originally requested.",
        "The parameter is used to determine the inference behavior for any Snowflake feature supported by cross-region inference, including\nCortex LLM Functions.",
