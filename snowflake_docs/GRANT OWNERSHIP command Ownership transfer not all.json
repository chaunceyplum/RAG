        "When you grant the USAGE privilege on a database to a share, you can execute the GRANT OWNERSHIP command to transfer the OWNERSHIP\nprivilege on the database to a different role. For example:",

If you try to do this, Snowflake returns\nthe following error message:",
        "To avoid this error message and transfer the OWNERSHIP privilege to a different role, revoke the USAGE privilege on the database from the\nshare, transfer the OWNERSHIP privilege on the database to a different role, and grant the USAGE privilege on the database to the share.\nFor example:",
