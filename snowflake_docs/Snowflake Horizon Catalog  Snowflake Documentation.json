        "Snowflake Horizon Catalog lets organizations discover and govern data, apps, and models\nthrough a built-in set of compliance, security, privacy, discovery, and collaboration capabilities. It\u2019s a unified solution addressing\nenterprise-wide challenges while meeting the diverse needs of users working with the organization\u2019s content.",
        "Snowflake Horizon Catalog provides a solution for everyone with a stake in governing, discovering, or taking action on an organization\u2019s\ncontent. These stakeholders include the following:",
        "Data stewards want to provide access to data, apps, and models while still ensuring that the right people have access to the content. They\nwant to identify sensitive data and appropriately protect it. It\u2019s their job to determine who\u2019s using what data and understand the\nquality of the data.",
        "Horizon Catalog lets data stewards effectively govern the organization\u2019s content with a built-in solution. They can protect content on\na granular level to safely make it available to a wider audience; use tools that monitor security, quality of data, and flow of sensitive\ndata; and continually audit who has accessed data and whether that access was done securely.",
        "Data teams of analysts, data scientists, and data engineers often struggle with finding the right data, app, or model for their task.\nAfter they find an object, it\u2019s hard to tell if the data is up-to-date and trustworthy, what the columns mean, and who owns it. Even when\nthey\u2019ve determined it\u2019s the right data, getting access to it can take days or weeks.",
        "Horizon Catalog helps data teams find and collaborate on relevant content faster.  Horizon Catalog helps these teams extract more\nvalue from content by making it easier to find the right data, understand the data so they can trust that it meets requirements, and take\naction on that data. Data teams can enhance collaboration and data-driven decisions by leveraging organizational listings to\ndiscover and include relevant and up-to-date data products shared by their coworkers and auto-fulfilled through the Internal Marketplace.",
        "Horizon Catalog governs and makes discoverable more than just Snowflake tables and views in the internal storage of an account. It covers\na range of content, including the following:",
        "Data, apps, and models in accounts across your entire organization, including data shared using organizational listings and the Internal Marketplace.",
        "Data from Apache Iceberg\u2122 tables and external tables.",
        "Data shared through\nprivate listings by\ntrusted partners.",
        "Publicly available data and every Snowflake Native App from the\nSnowflake Marketplace.",
        "Data from third-party applications and data systems brought into Snowflake using\nconnectors.",
        "Horizon Catalog provides the tools a data steward needs to govern an organization\u2019s data, apps, and models.",
        "Horizon Catalog lets you do the following:",
        "Audit the access history and object dependencies of\ncontent.",
        "Monitor data quality using built-in and custom data metric functions, which lets you\ntroubleshoot and visualize. You can configure an alert based on the centralized table to enable near-real-time data quality\nnotifications.",
        "View data lineage in Snowsight to understand the table and column lineage\nfrom a source table to a target table, and set tags on columns that appear in either a downstream or upstream table.",
        "View object insights [1] using a user interface that lets you learn information about tables and views without writing SQL. You\ncan determine who is accessing the data, the queries that access the data most frequently, whether someone has been modifying the\ngovernance posture of the data, whether there are downstream or upstream dependencies on the data, and whether the data has been\nclassified as sensitive.",
        "Track data by monitoring tags, which can be user-defined tags implemented with object tagging or\nclassification tags (system-defined or custom) that have\nbeen automatically assigned to columns based on the content of the column.",
        "[1] Currently in private preview.",
        "Horizon Catalog lets you do the following:",
        "Use the Trust Center to determine the current security posture of an account, including\nwhether it meets the benchmarks established by the Center for Internet Security (CIS).",
        "Use end-to-end encryption to prevent third parties from reading data while at-rest\nor in transit to and from Snowflake while minimizing the attack surface.",
        "Choose your preferred authentication method such as OAuth or\nfederated authentication.",
        "Use granular authorization controls to control access to objects.",
        "Define and apply data access policies to provide column-level and\nrow-level protections.",
        "Horizon Catalog lets you do the following:",
        "Define and assign aggregation policies and\nprojection policies to control what type of queries can be run against shared data. Aggregation\npolicies require analysts to run queries that aggregate data rather than retrieving individual rows. Projection policies control whether\nan analyst can use a SELECT statement to project a particular column.",
        "Open up highly sensitive data to analysts while protecting the identity of individuals.\nDifferential privacy uses rigorous\nmathematics to protect against sophisticated privacy attacks on your data.",
        "Facilitate collaboration while preserving privacy using a Snowflake Data Clean Room.",
        "Expand who can learn insights from sensitive data by synthetically generating data with similar characteristics that they can\nwork with directly.",
        "Data teams rely on an organization\u2019s data, apps, and models to do their job. Horizon Catalog provides these teams with the tools they need\nto discover content for their task, evaluate that content to ensure it\u2019s relevant and trustworthy, and take action on the content.",
        "Horizon Catalog lets you do the following:",
        "Use the Internal Marketplace to discover and take action on data within\nyour organization. The Internal Marketplace is a company-exclusive site that lets you discover organizational listings. The\nwiki-like listing pages, complete with data dictionaries and validated SQL examples, simplify the identification of data products\ncurated by internal teams. No extra setup is needed \u2014 just copy the listing name, and the data is ready for immediate use.",
        "Search for data, apps, and models using Universal Search, which is a user interface\nthat lets you find content inside and outside your organization using natural language.",
        "Quickly understand the contents of a table and its columns by reading AI-generated descriptions. Object owners can click\na single button in Snowsight to generate these descriptions, which\nincreases the likelihood that objects and columns have useful comments. These useful comments improve the discoverability of the objects\nthrough Universal Search.",
        "Browse publicly available data on the Snowflake\nMarketplace.",
        "Evaluate the relevancy of data by using object insights in Snowsight [3] to look at the popularity, access, quality, and\ndependencies of content.",
        "[3] Currently in private preview.",
        "Horizon Catalog lets you do the following:",
        "Share data within your organization in the Internal Marketplace and\nprivately with external business partners using\nprivate listings.",

        "Suppose BazFin, a large financial services firm, needs to ensure the compliance, data quality, and usability of its content, which\nconsists of 10 PB of data. BazFin uses Horizon Catalog to govern and discover content.",
        "The chief data officer (CDO) of BazFin needs to assure company stakeholders that business decisions are based on high-quality data. The\nCDO instructs the data steward to leverage system-defined and custom data metric functions to\ncontinually monitor data quality on a regular schedule. On any given day, the CDO can view a dashboard built on the events table to report\non data quality.",
        "Returning to her work for the day, the data steward opens the Trust Center to check the overall\nsecurity posture of a Snowflake account that was recently created for a new division. From a built-in interface, she identifies that\nsomeone forgot to define a network policy to protect the account from unknown network traffic.",
        "A BazFin analyst wants to build a new dashboard to show top-performing products. The analyst goes to the Internal Marketplace\nand finds just the right organizational listing with performance data published by the finance team. The analyst browses\nthrough a Data Dictionary to preview the data, then starts querying the data right away using the listing\u2019s\nUnified Listing Locator.",
        "The analyst also wants to enrich BazFin data with third-party data. Turning to\nUniversal Search, the analyst uses the natural language search term\nincome bands for zipcodes, which returns a data product from the Snowflake Marketplace that they can join with the BazFin product\nperformance data.",
