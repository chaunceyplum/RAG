        "This topic provides instructions on using replication to allow data providers\nto securely share data with data consumers across different regions and\ncloud platforms.",
        "Note",
        "If you use listings to share data with specific consumer accounts, or you use the Snowflake Marketplace,\nyou can use Cross-Cloud Auto-fulfillment\nto automatically fulfill your data product to other regions.",
        "Cross-region data sharing is supported by Snowflake accounts hosted on any of the following cloud platforms:",
        "Amazon Web Services (AWS)",
        "Google Cloud Platform (GCP)",
        "Microsoft Azure (Azure)",
        "Important",
        "If you replicate a primary database to accounts in a geographic region or country that is different from that in which your source\nSnowflake account is located, you should confirm that your organization does not have any legal or regulatory restrictions as to where\nyour data can be transferred or hosted.",
        "Since cross-region data sharing utilizes Snowflake data replication functionality, understand how replication works in Snowflake\nas part of your planning process. For more information, see:",

        "Replication considerations",
        "Replicating databases and account objects across multiple accounts",
        "Data providers only need to create one copy of the dataset per region; and not a copy per consumer.",
        "When sharing a view that references objects in multiple databases, each of these other databases must be included in the replication\ngroup. Sharing data from more than one database requires additional steps. For instructions, see\nShare data from multiple databases.",

        "Snowflake data providers can share data with data consumers in a different region in a few simple steps.",
        "Note",
        "Before configuring data replication, you must create an account in a region where you wish to share data and link it to your local\naccount. For more information, see Working with organizations and accounts.",
        "Setting up data replication involves the following tasks:",
        "Enable replication for your accounts.",
        "A user with the ORGADMIN role must enable replication for the source account that contains the data to share and the target accounts\nin regions where you want to share data with consumers. For instructions on enabling replication,\nsee Prerequisite: Enable replication for accounts in the organization. For more information about the ORGADMIN role,\nsee Getting started with organizations.",

        "Replicate the group with the databases and shares to the regions where you want to share data with consumers.",
        "Sharing data with data consumers in the same region involves adding one or more consumer accounts to the\nsecondary shares that you replicated from the source account.",

        "A data provider, Acme, wants to share data with data consumers in a different region.",
        "To create a replication group that contains the databases and shares to replicate to another region, execute the following\nSQL statement.",

        "From the target account in the other region, execute the following SQL statements.\nAny account that you add to the share should be local to the region of the target account.\nAfter you alter the share to set a list of accounts (targets), your added accounts won\u2019t be overwritten in the next refresh.",

        "A data provider, Acme, wants to share a subset of data with data consumers in a different region. To reduce replication costs, they\nwould like to only replicate the relevant rows from their master table. Since replication is done at the database level, this example\ndescribes how Acme can use streams and tasks to copy the desired rows from the main database to a new database, create a share and\ngrant privileges on the view, and replicate both in a replication group to an account in a different region for consumer access.\nIn this scenario the new database and share are designated as primary objects for data replication.",
        "Use the following SQL commands to create a new database in the source account and enable replication.",
