        "Release notes for Native SDK for Connectors Java library.",
        "New identifier approach.",
        "Important",
        "This  new approach may change how identifiers are used in your connector, please test the new changes thoroughly!",
        "The SDK now expects all identifiers to be sent as provided by the user; the SDK will asses by itself whether it\u2019s a quoted identifier or not in order to process it correctly further.",
        "Auto quoting of identifiers will be done only when using values returned by Snowflake queries.",
        "To use the new approach with the UI - the connector must return a new property in the PUBLIC.APP_PROPERTIES view, with the key of UI_ADD_QUOTES_TO_EXISTING_QUOTED_IDENTIFIERS and a value of TRUE.",
        "Changed com.snowflake.connectors.common.object.Identifier class:",
        "Removed fromWithAutoQuoting() and getName() methods.",
        "Removed the concept of an empty identifier; removed empty(), isNullOrEmpty(), validateNullOrEmpty(), and isEmpty() methods.",
        "Added new from() method, which allows for enabling of auto quoting during identifier instance creation; the provided String will not be auto quoted if it is an unquoted, fully uppercase identifier.",
        "Changed validate() method to isValid().",
        "Changed toSqlString() method to getValue().",
        "Added getUnquotedValue(), getQuotedValue(), getVariantValue(), and isUnquoted() methods.",
        "Changed com.snowflake.connectors.common.object.ObjectName class:",
        "Made database and schema properties Optional.",
        "Changed return type of getDatabase() and getSchema() to Optional.",
        "Changed validate() method to isValid().",
        "Changed validateDoubleDot() method to isDoubleDot().",
        "Changed getEscapedName() method to getValue().",
        "Added getVariantValue() and getSchemaName() methods.",
        "Changed com.snowflake.connectors.common.object.Reference class:",
        "Removed the concept of an empty reference; removed empty() and isEmpty() methods.",
        "Changed validate() method to isValid().",
        "Changed referenceName() method to getName().",
        "Changed value() method to getValue().",
        "Added new com.snowflake.connectors.common.object.SchemaName class for representing the schema; similar behavior to com.snowflake.connectors.common.object.ObjectName class.",
        "Added new com.snowflake.connectors.common.object.InvalidSchemaNameException class.",
        "Changed applyToAllInitializedTaskReactorInstances() method in the com.snowflake.connectors.taskreactor.TaskReactorInstanceActionExecutor to execute an action only on initialized task reactor instances. Previous behavior: actions were executed on all registered task reactor instances.",
        "Resource management procedures:",
        "Introduced new callbacks to PUBLIC.CREATE_RESOURCE() procedure that allows to perform custom operations during the procedure flow.\nSee also Create resource.",
        "New PUBLIC.ENABLE_RESOURCE() procedure that allows to enable disabled resource.\nAdditionally there are added callbacks that allow to perform custom operations during the procedure flow.\nSee also Enable resource.",
        "New PUBLIC.DISABLE_RESOURCE() procedure that allows to disable enabled resource.\nAdditionally there are added callbacks that allow to perform custom operations during the procedure flow.\nSee also Disable resource.",
        "New PUBLIC.UPDATE_RESOURCE() procedure that allows to update ingestion configurations of a particular resource.\nAdditionally there are added callbacks that allow to perform custom operations during the procedure flow.\nSee also Update resource.",
        "com.snowflake.connectors.util.sql.SqlTools:",
        "Added asVarchar() method that is expected to replace varcharArgument() method.",
        "Added asVariant() method that is expected to replace variantArgument() method.",
        "Marked varcharArgument() and variantArgument() methods as deprecated and set them to be removed in the future.",
        "Other additions:",
        "Defined Ingestion Process status as constants in the com.snowflake.connectors.application.ingestion.process.IngestionProcessStatuses class.",
        "Added isNotOk() method to com.snowflake.connectors.common.response.ConnectorResponse class.",
        "Added com.snowflake.connectors.util.snowflake.DefaultTransactionManager class that allows to execute sql statements within a transaction by using the withTransaction() method.",
        "Improved logging in the task reactor.",
        "Fixed bug that resulted in removing task reactor instance schema, once unexpected error was raised during CREATE_INSTANCE_OBJECTS() procedure.",
