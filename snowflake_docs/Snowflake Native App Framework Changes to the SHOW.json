        "Attention",
        "This behavior change is in the 2024_07 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "When this behavior change bundle is enabled, the output of the SHOW APPLICATIONS\nDESCRIBE APPLICATION commands include the following changes.",
        "The output of the SHOW APPLICATIONS command includes the following new columns:",
        "Column name",
        "Description",
        "disablement_reasons",
        "An array containing the reasons why the Snowflake Native App was disabled. See\nPossible statuses for a disabled app for the\nlist of possible reasons.",
        "last_upgraded_on",
        "The timestamp of the last successful upgrade of the app. The timestamp is empty if there is no successful upgrade.",
        "Previously, if an app is disabled, the DESCRIBE APPLICATION command returns an error code to indicate that the app is disabled.",
        "The DESCRIBE APPLICATION command succeeds and the reason the app is disabled is included in the output in a new column:",
        "Column name",
        "Description",
        "disablement_reasons",
        "An array containing the reasons why the Snowflake Native App was disabled. See\nPossible statuses for a disabled app for the\nlist of possible reasons.",
        "The following table lists the possible values for the DISABLEMENT_REASONS column:",

        "The app is disabled by Snowflake",
        "Yes. To re-enable the app, contact Snowflake Support.",
        "ACCOUNT_INACTIVE",
        "The account becomes inactive by being locked or suspended causing the app to be unavailable.\nIn this state a consumer cannot execute any SQL queries in their account and the app cannot be upgraded.",
        "Yes. The app is automatically re-enabled if the account lock or suspension is removed",
        "PACKAGE_VERSION_IS_MISSING",
        "The application package version for the app was dropped by the provider. The app is no longer usable\nand must be dropped and reinstalled from a valid listing or application package",

        "CMK_ACCESS_DENIED",
        "The consumer manages the encryption key themselves (ENCRYPT_USE_CMK_KMS is enabled) and\nSnowflake doesn\u2019t have access to this key.",
        "Yes. To re-enable the app, ensure that the cloud provider configuration to retrieve the CMK is correct\nand that Snowflake has access to the key.",
        "LISTING_ACCESS_REVOKED",
        "The listing used to create the app is no longer available. Possible reasons for this status include:",
        "The provider deleted the listing",
        "The provider manually removed access to the private listing from the consumer account",
        "Possibly. Recoverability depends on the reason why access was revoked.",
        "For example, if the listing was deleted it is not recoverable. If a consumer account was\nmanually removed from the private listing, access to the listing and app can be restored.",

        "The application has exceeded the usage limit for a usage-based trial listing.",

        "The app resources for example, tasks, services, and compute pools, are suspended due to\nthe app being disabled.",
        "The suspended objects remain suspended until the app is re-enabled and there are no other\nreasons the app was disabled.",
