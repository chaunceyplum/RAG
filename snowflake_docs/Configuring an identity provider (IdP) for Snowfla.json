        "The tasks for configuring an IdP are different depending on whether you choose Okta, AD FS, or another (i.e. custom) SAML 2.0-compliant service/application to\nprovide federated authentication for your Snowflake users.",
        "Important",
        "Prior to configuring your IdP, consider how to manage federated authentication after it is fully configured and how users will access Snowflake through\nfederated authentication.",
        "For example, decide whether users will access Snowflake through a public URL or through a URL associated with\nprivate connectivity to the Snowflake service. To learn more, see Managing/Using federated authentication.",
        "To use Okta as your IdP for federated authentication, you must perform the following tasks in Okta:",
        "Create an Okta account for your company or organization.",
        "Log into your Okta account as a user with administrator privileges and create a user for each person who will need access to Snowflake. When creating\nusers, make sure to include an email address for each user. Email addresses are required to map the users in Okta with the corresponding users in Snowflake.",
        "Note",
        "Remember to ensure the email address you enter in Okta value maps to the login_name value in Snowflake and the SAML NameID attribute.",
        "For more information, see Step 1 in Migrating to a SAML2 security integration.",
        "Create a Snowflake application in Okta:",
        "In the Label field for the application, you can specify any name.",
        "In the SubDomain field for the application, enter the account identifier of\nyour Snowflake account. If you are using private connectivity, append privatelink to the account identifier. For example, if the\nURL used to access the Snowflake account is https://myorg-myaccount.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com, then\nenter myorg-myaccount.privatelink.",
        "If the Snowflake account name contains an underscore and you are using the account name format of the identifier, you need to convert\nthe underscore to a hyphen because Okta does not support underscores in URLs (e.g. myorg-myaccount-name).",
        "Assign the Okta users you created to the Snowflake application in Okta.",
        "Configure SAML 2.0 as the sign on method for the Snowflake application you created. You will need the SSO URL value and certificate in the next step,\nMigrating to a SAML2 security integration.",

        "To use AD FS as your IdP for federated authentication, you must perform the following tasks in AD FS.",
        "Verify that AD FS 3.0 is installed and working on Windows Server 2012 R2.",
        "Ensure that a user exists in AD FS for each person who will need access to Snowflake. When creating users, make sure to include an email address for each\nuser. Email addresses are required to connect the users in AD FS with their corresponding users in Snowflake.",

        "Other versions of AD FS and Windows Server can be used; however, the configuration instructions may be different.",

        "In the Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL field, enter the SSO URL for your Snowflake account appended with /fed/login. For example, to use the Account Name URL with private connectivity, enter: https://<orgname>-<account_name>.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com/fed/login. For a list of possible URL formats, see Connecting with a URL. When you create the security integration for federated authentication, make sure its URL parameters match the format used in this field.",
