        "The compression method name (e.g. ZLIB) is case insensitive.",
        "If you use DECOMPRESS_STRING to decompress a compressed BINARY\nvalue, rather than a compressed string value, you do\nnot necessarily get an error; instead, the function attempts to treat\nthe BINARY value as a sequence of hexadecimal digits and then attempts\nto convert those hexadecimal digits into printable characters. Snowflake\nrecommends that you use the DECOMPRESS_BINARY function to decompress\ncompressed data if the original data was BINARY.",
