        "Array that represents the categories. Must contain at least two and at most 100 unique categories. Categories are case\nsensitive. If these requirements are not met, the function returns an error. For a full list of errors, see\nError conditions.",
        "Categories may be simple strings or SQL objects; all categories must be the same type. Using objects, you can\nprovide a description and examples of each category, providing context that can help improve classification accuracy.\nIt is not required to provide descriptions or examples for each category; you are free to provide a description,\nexamples, both, or neither for each category.",
        "label: The name of the category. This key is required.",
        "description: A description of the category. Descriptions should be no longer than about 25 words (1-2 sentences) long.\nThis key is optional.",
        "examples: An array of examples that are representative of the category. Typically no more than five examples are needed,\nbut there is a limit of 20 examples per category. The number of examples does not need to be the same for every category.\nThis key is optional.",
