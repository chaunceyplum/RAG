        "The following new features, behavior changes, and updates (enhancements, fixes, etc.) have been introduced this month. If you have any\nquestions about these additions, please contact\nSnowflake Support.",
        "Important",
        "Each release may include updates that require the web interface to be refreshed.",
        "As a general practice, to ensure these updates do not impact your usage, we recommend refreshing the web interface after each Snowflake\nrelease has been deployed.",
        "We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of the following new region(s):",
        "Cloud Platform",
        "Region",
        "Microsoft Azure",
        "South Central US (Texas)",
        "With the addition of this region, Snowflake now supports over thirty global regions across three cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, and Azure),\nincluding three regions that support compliance with US government regulations.",
        "The new region supports all Snowflake editions. You can provision initial accounts in the region\nthrough self-service or a Snowflake representative.",
        "With this release, a new view, COMPLETE_TASK_GRAPHS,\nhas been added in preview to the Account Usage views (in the SNOWFLAKE shared\ndatabase) to help you analyze the history of completed task graph runs.  A graph is defined as a single scheduled task or a simple tree\nof tasks composed of a scheduled root task and one or more child tasks (i.e. tasks that have a defined predecessor task).",
        "The output of this new view is identical to that of the new COMPLETE_TASK_GRAPHS table function in the Information Schema.",
        "With this release, two new table functions that return the history of task graph runs have been added in preview to the Snowflake\nInformation Schema:",
        "Table Function Name",
        "Description",
        "COMPLETE_TASK_GRAPHS",
        "Returns the status of a completed graph run. The function returns details for runs that executed successfully, failed, or were\ncanceled in the past 60 minutes.",
        "The ERROR_ONLY=>TRUE argument filters the results and returns the history of failed or canceled task runs within a specified date\nrange.",
        "CURRENT_TASK_GRAPHS",
        "Returns the status of a graph run that is currently scheduled or is executing.",
        "These table functions return the history of task runs for up to 14 days.",
        "With this release, you can filter the TASK_HISTORY function output and retrieve the history of failed or\ncanceled task runs within a specified date range. Set the new ERROR_ONLY=>TRUE argument when querying the function to filter the results.",
        "This functionality is currently in preview.",
        "With this release, Snowflake adds support to enable email notifications for resource monitors for non-administrator users (users who do not\nhave the ACCOUNTADMIN role).",
        "Support for this feature is implemented through a new parameter, NOTIFY_USERS, for resource monitors that can be set when the resource\nmonitor is created (using CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR), or later (using\nALTER RESOURCE MONITOR). You can add up to five non-administrator users to a resource monitor to receive email\nnotifications.",
        "There are some limitations for non-administrator users:",
        "Non-administrator users are notified by email but cannot see notifications in the web interface.",
        "Non-administrator users cannot create resource monitors.",
        "Non-administrator users cannot be notified of account level resource monitors.",
        "Non-administrator users cannot assign other users to be notified.",
        "See Resource monitor notifications for more details.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce a new parameter to set a minimum number of days for which Snowflake retains historical\ndata for performing Time Travel operations. The MIN_DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter can be set by account\nadministrators at the account level and can be used to enforce a minimum data retention period on all permanent tables in the account.",
        "Setting this parameter at the account level does not alter the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter value that is explicitly\nset on databases, schemas, or tables. It may, however, change the effective data retention period for an object. When this parameter is set\non an account, the data retention period for an object is determined by MAX(DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS, MIN_DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS).",
        "For more details, see Understanding & using Time Travel.",
        "We are pleased to announce an open preview of unstructured data extraction and processing using\nJava user-defined functions (UDFs) or\ntabular Java UDFs (UDTFs).",
        "Unstructured data is data that lacks a predefined structure. It is often textual, such as open-ended survey responses and social media\nconversations, but can also be non-textual, including images, video, and audio. Java UDFs enable you to perform custom operations using the\nJava programming language to manipulate data and return either scalar or tabular results. Call your custom UDFs and compiled code to extract\ntext, process images, and perform other operations on unstructured data for analysis.",
        "You can either include the Java code inline in the function definition or package the code in a JAR file and copy the file to an internal or\nexternal stage. Call the UDF with the input as a scoped URL, file URL, or the string file path for one or more files located in an internal\nor external stage. The new SnowflakeFile class enables you to easily pass additional file attributes when calling the UDF, such as\nfile size, to filter the results.",
        "Previously, Snowflake customers were limited to processing unstructured files using external functions and remote API services.",
        "This feature is currently in preview. Preview features are intended for evaluation and testing purposes, and are not recommended for use in\nproduction.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the general availability of write operations in the ACCESS_HISTORY view (Account Usage).\nWrite operations are recorded in the objects_modified column of the ACCESS_HISTORY view.",
        "This update provides a more unified picture of what data was accessed, when the data access took place, and how the accessed data moved from\nthe data source object to the data target object.",
        "For a complete list of supported write operations (e.g. CTAS, COPY \u2026 INTO TABLE), see the usage notes section in the\nACCESS_HISTORY view.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the general availability of object dependencies in the\nOBJECT_DEPENDENCIES view (Account Usage).",
        "This update provides data stewards and data engineers a unified picture of the relationships between referencing objects and referenced\nobjects. For example, when a table owner plans to modify a column, querying the OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES view based on the table name returns\nall of the objects (e.g. views) that will be affected by the modification.",
        "For more details, see Object Dependencies.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the general availability of allowed values for object tagging. This update allows tag\nadministrators to specify the tag string values that can be used when a tag key is set on a supported object.",
        "For example, the tag cost_center can now be configured to have the allowed string values of marketing and engineering. When this\ntag is set on a supported object, such as a warehouse or share, the string values that can be used are marketing and engineering only.\nTag administrators can optionally add more allowed string values or drop existing allowed string values as needed. The maximum number of\nallowed values a tag can have is 50.",
        "For details, see Object Tagging.",
        "With this release, Snowflake adds support to the ACCESS_HISTORY view (Account Usage) to\nrecord operations from the TRUNCATE TABLE command.",
        "The objects_modified column in the ACCESS_HISTORY review records the table that was specified in the TRUNCATE TABLE command and all\ncolumns in the specified table.",
        "Snowflake is committed to providing the highest levels of service to our global users. To support this commitment, we are pleased to announce\nthe availability of Snowflake Documentation in Korean at https://docs.snowflake.com/ko/.",
        "In line with the other documentation translated from English, the new Korean translated documentation will be updated weekly as we release\nnew features, enhancements, and fixes, with a period of time, typically 5-7 business days (and sometimes longer), between the updates in\nEnglish and the translated documentation.",
