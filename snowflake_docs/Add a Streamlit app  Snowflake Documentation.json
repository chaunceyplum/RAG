        "See Add additional packages to a Streamlit app for more information.",

        "See Add a Streamlit app to the manifest file for more information.",
        "Upload the Streamlit files, environment.yml file, setup script  and manifest.yml\nfiles to a named stage. To include Streamlit code files in an application package, the files must be\nuploaded to a named stage.",
        "Test the application package.",
        "After creating the files required by the application package and Streamlit app, create an application\nobject to test the setup script and manifest.yml file.",

        "To test the Streamlit app, view the app in Snowsight. See\nTest the Streamlit app in Snowsight.",
        "Like other Python modules, to add a Streamlit app to an application package you must upload\nyour Streamlit code files to a named stage. See PUT for information\non how to upload files to a stage.",
        "To account for multiple versions of a Snowflake Native App, consider using a directory structure similar to the following\nto maintain your Streamlit apps and related application files:",
        "Note that the directory structure you create depends on the requirements of your app and\ndevelopment environment.",

        "You can only install packages listed in the\nSnowflake Anaconda Channel.\nSnowflake does not support external Anaconda channels in Streamlit.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework supports multiple versions of the Streamlit library. To set the Streamlit version within\na Snowflake Native App add streamlit to the dependencies section of the environment.yml file\nas shown in the following example:",
        "Snowflake recommends explicitly setting the Streamlit version for your app. However, currently, if you\ndo not explicitly set the version of the Streamlit library, Streamlit version 1.22.0 is set as the default.",
        "To specify the default Streamlit app launched by your native app, add the following entries in the\nmanifest.yml file.",
        "The default_streamlit: app_schema.streamlit_app_na entry specifies the location of the\nschema containing your Streamlit app.",
        "To test the application package containing the Streamlit app, create an application object using\nthe files on a named stage by running the CREATE APPLICATION as shown\nin the following example:",
        "Depending on what you need to test, you can create the application object using other\nforms of the CREATE APPLICATION. For example, you may want to\ntest the Streamlit app as part of a version or upgrade. See\nInstall and test an app locally.",
        "To test the Streamlit app, view the app in Snowsight by doing the following:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",

        "To use Streamlit and packages provided by Anaconda in Snowflake, you must acknowledge the\nExternal Offerings Terms.\nTo learn more, see Using third-party packages from Anaconda.",
        "Each Streamlit app uses a unique subdomain. If you use strict firewalls, add *.snowflake.app\nto your firewall allowlist. Adding this entry to your allowlist allows your apps to communicate with\nSnowflake servers without any restrictions.",
