        "A stage is a location that holds data files to load into a Snowflake database. This tutorial creates\na stage that loads data from an Amazon S3 bucket. This tutorial uses an existing bucket with\na CSV file that contains the data. You load the data from this CSV file into the table you created\npreviously. For information, see Bulk loading from Amazon S3.",
