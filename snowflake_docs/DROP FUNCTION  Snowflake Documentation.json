        "Specifies the data type of the argument(s), if any, for the UDF. The argument types are necessary because UDFs support name\noverloading (i.e. two UDFs in the same schema can have the same name) and the argument types are used to identify the UDF you\nwish to drop.",

        "For UDFs that store code in a file (such as a .jar file or .py file) in a stage, the DROP FUNCTION command does not remove\nthe file. Different UDFs can use different functions/methods in the same file, so the file should not be removed while any UDF\nrefers to it. Snowflake does not store a count of the number of references to each staged file and does not remove that staged\nfile when there are no remaining references.",
