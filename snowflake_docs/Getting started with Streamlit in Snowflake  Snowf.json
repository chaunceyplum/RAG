        "This topic describes how to begin using Streamlit in Snowflake.",
        "To use Streamlit in Snowflake, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:",
        "Have privileges required to create and use a Streamlit\napp.",
        "To use Mapbox in Streamlit in Snowflake and the packages provided\nby Anaconda, you must acknowledge the\nExternal Offerings Terms.",
        "For information about using these packages, see Using Third-Party Packages from Anaconda.",
        "Ensure that *.snowflake.app is allowlisted in your network and that the app can connect to Snowflake.",
        "For more information, see You cannot load the Streamlit app.",
        "Within Streamlit in Snowflake, a Streamlit app is a securable object that adheres to the\nSnowflake access control framework.\nStreamlit apps use a permission model that is based on owner\u2019s rights. For more information, see Understanding owner\u2019s rights and Streamlit in Snowflake apps.",
        "An app editor and the owner of the schema containing the Streamlit app can determine which roles have\npermission to use the app. Users can interact with the app and can see anything displayed by\nthe Streamlit app. Users have the same view of the app as the owner does.",
        "For more information, see Share a Streamlit app.",
        "Streamlit apps are schema-level objects.",
        "To create and edit a Streamlit app by using Streamlit in Snowflake, you must use a role that has either the OWNERSHIP privilege on the schema, or both of the following privileges:",
        "Granted on the database that contains the Streamlit app:",
        "USAGE",
        "Granted on the schema that contains the Streamlit app:",
        "USAGE",
        "CREATE STREAMLIT",
        "CREATE STAGE",
        "You must also have the USAGE privilege on the warehouse used to run the Streamlit app.",
        "Use the GRANT <privileges> command to grant these privileges to a role, as shown in this example:",
        "If a future grant is defined on the database or schema, ensure that the user creates the Streamlit app using the role defined\nin the future grant.",
        "To view a Streamlit app, you must have a Snowflake account and be signed in. Additionally,\nyou must use a role that is granted the USAGE privilege on the following objects:",
        "The database that contains the Streamlit app",
        "The schema that contains the Streamlit app",
        "The Streamlit app",
        "In most cases, when the app owner shares a Streamlit app with another role, the USAGE privilege is\nautomatically granted to the new role. However, if a Streamlit app is created in a schema with\nMANAGED ACCESS, the USAGE privilege must be manually granted to the new role.",
        "The schema owner or a user with the role with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege must grant the USAGE\nprivilege using the GRANT <privileges> command as shown in this example:",
        "Streamlit in Snowflake supports the following versions of the Streamlit open-source library:",
        "1.39.0 (currently in preview)",
        "1.35.0",
        "1.31.1",
        "1.29.0",
        "1.26.0",
        "1.22.0",
        "To view release notes for each version, see Streamlit library changelog.\nNote that some features of the open-source Streamlit library are unsupported in Streamlit in Snowflake.\nSee Unsupported Streamlit features.",
        "For each Streamlit in Snowflake app, you can select the Streamlit library version in Snowsight or pin the version in the app\u2019s\nenvironment.yml file. If you do not pin the version, the latest available version is used.",
        "Snowflake recommends pinning a version of Streamlit to prevent the app from being upgraded when a new version\nof Streamlit becomes available in the Snowflake Anaconda Channel.",
        "By default, Streamlit in Snowflake includes the python, streamlit, and snowflake-snowpark-python packages\npre-installed in your environment. The environment also has access to the dependencies required by these packages.",
        "Streamlit in Snowflake apps run in Python 3.8.",
        "You can install additional packages in your Streamlit app. For a list of supported packages, see the\nSnowflake Anaconda Channel.",
        "See the following topics for information about including a supported package in your Streamlit app:",
        "Manage packages for a Streamlit app",
        "Manage packages by using the environment.yml file",
        "When you run a Streamlit app in Streamlit in Snowflake, multiple factors may affect performance, including\nthe complexity of the Streamlit app, availability of warehouses, latency, and cost. The following sections\nprovide general guidelines for using virtual warehouses in Streamlit in Snowflake.",
        "When you run a Streamlit app in Streamlit in Snowflake, you should select the smallest warehouse possible.",
        "When running, a warehouse maintains a cache of the Python packages used by a Streamlit app.\nCaching Python packages improves the performance for later app loads by using the cached version\nof a package instead of downloading the packages again.  The cache is removed when the warehouse is\nsuspended, which may result in a slower loading of the app initially after the warehouse is resumed. As the resumed\nwarehouse runs more apps, the package cache is rebuilt, and apps that can take\nadvantage of the cache will experience improved app loading performance.",
        "Note that per-second credit billing and auto-suspend give you the flexibility to start with smaller\nwarehouses and then adjust the size of the warehouse to match the workload of the Streamlit app. You\ncan increase the size of a warehouse at any time. For more information, see Change the warehouse of a Streamlit app.",
        "When you use Streamlit in Snowflake, Snowflake recommends using a dedicated warehouse for running Streamlit apps. This\nenables you to isolate the costs of running a Streamlit app. A dedicated warehouse may also improve\nthe load time of the app because the warehouse does not have to manage other workloads.",
        "For more information, see Warehouse considerations.",
        "Tip",
        "To avoid warehouse suspension during initialization, consider setting auto-suspend to\na minimum of 30 seconds.",
        "Streamlit apps use a virtual warehouse to run the app and its queries. More advanced apps and use cases might involve\nrunning a complex query, which requires a larger warehouse.",
        "Streamlit in Snowflake supports the USE WAREHOUSE command, which specifies a current warehouse for the session.\nWith this command, you can run the app using an X-Small warehouse and run complex queries using a larger warehouse.",
        "You can use a separate warehouse to run queries in a Streamlit app with this code:",
        "Note",
        "The warehouse is used only for the duration of the query.",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "In the navigation menu, select Projects \u00bb Streamlit.",
        "Select + Streamlit App.",
        "Enter a title for the app, and choose a database, schema, and warehouse.",
        "Select Create.",
        "In this section, you edit the new Streamlit app to access data from a Snowflake table.",
        "Create a BUG_REPORT_DATA table in your database and schema:",
