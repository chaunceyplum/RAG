    "paragraphs": [
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the availability of the following new features and enhancements in this update to Snowflake\nData Clean Rooms.",
        "A provider can use a template chain to define a sequence of templates to be executed in a particular order. The results of one template\nwithin the sequence can be used as input for a subsequent template in the chain. A clean room user executes a template chain to perform an\nanalysis that runs the templates in their predefined order.",
        "For more information, see Using the developer APIs to execute templates sequentially.",
        "For increased security, users are required to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) when signing in to the web app. Existing\nSnowflake Data Clean Room customers will be sent an email explaining how to enable MFA.",
        "For information about enabling and authenticating with MFA, see Sign in to the web app.",
        "Collaborators can now register individual tables and views in a managed access schema (that is, a schema created with the WITH MANAGE\nACCESS clause) without registering other objects in the schema. Objects must be registered before they can be linked into a clean room.",
        "For more information, see Registering data.",
        "Snowflake Data Clean Rooms are now available in the following region:",
        "Cloud platform",
        "Supported region",

        "Consumers can use the SQL Query template to run analyses without adding tables or defining joins when installing the clean room, which lets\na provider share a clean room designed for SQL queries against the provider\u2019s data only.",
