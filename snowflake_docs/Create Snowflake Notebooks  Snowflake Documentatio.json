        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "Generally available in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) commercial regions.",
        "This topic describes how to create Snowflake Notebooks on a warehouse runtime. You can also create Snowflake Notebooks on container runtime for ML.\nFor details, see Create a notebook on Container Runtime for ML.",
        "You can access notebooks through Snowsight, where you can:",
        "Create a new notebook.",
        "Open an existing notebook.",
        "Tip",
        "You can also create a notebook using SQL. See CREATE NOTEBOOK.",
        "You have set up and enabled notebooks.",
        "You are using a role with the required privileges. If you are creating a private\nnotebook, you meet the prerequisites.",
        "You can create a new notebook by selecting + Notebook, or you can import a file with the *.ipynb extension. This could be\na notebook file created from an application outside of Snowflake.",
        "To create a new notebook, follow these steps:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "Select Projects \u00bb Notebooks in the left-side navigation menu.",
        "Select + Notebook.",
        "You have several options when creating a new notebook:",
        "To create a role-owned notebook, select your current primary role from the Creating as drop-down list.",
        "To create a private user-owned notebook, select your username from the\nCreating as drop-down list.",
        "To create a notebook from an existing file, such as a notebook file that was created from an application outside of Snowflake, select the\ndown arrow next to + Notebook and then select Import .ipynb file. Open the file to import.",
        "Note",
        "If your notebook imports Python packages, you must add the packages to the notebook before you can run the imported notebook. See\nImport Python packages to use in notebooks. If the package you use in your imported notebook is not available, your code might not run. For\ninformation about adding cells, see Develop and run code in Snowflake Notebooks.",
        "Enter a name for your notebook.",
        "Note",
        "If you\u2019re using an AWS region, you can specify the runtime environment for your notebook: either the Container Runtime for ML or the warehouse runtime.",
        "Select a Notebook location. This is the database and schema in which to store your notebook. These cannot be changed after you\ncreate the notebook. If you create a private notebook after personal databases are enabled for your account, your personal database will\nbe pre-populated by default under Notebook location. However, if you are creating a private notebook and there is only one schema\nin your personal database, the Notebook location options are not available.",
        "Note",
        "The Notebook location dropdown might not show databases that were created after the Create Notebook dialog was opened. If you cannot\nfind your recently created database, schema, or warehouse, try reloading your browser window.",
        "Querying data in the notebook is not restricted to this location. In the notebook, you can query data in any location you have access to.\nTo specify the location, run USE WAREHOUSE and USE SCHEMA.",
        "Select Run on warehouse or Run on container as your Python environment.",
        "(Optional) Select a Query warehouse to run any SQL and Snowpark queries issued by the notebook.",
        "Select Create to create and open your notebook.",
        "For information about adding cells, see Develop and run code in Snowflake Notebooks.",
        "You can sync your notebook development with a Git repository. Then you can create Snowflake Notebooks from notebooks in that Git repository.",
        "To create a notebook from a file in Git, see Create a notebook from a file in a Git repository.",
        "You can duplicate existing Snowflake Notebooks. Duplicating notebooks may be useful if you want to, for example, test out some code changes\nwithout altering the original notebook version.",
        "When you duplicate a notebook, the copied notebook is created with the same role and warehouse as the original notebook, and is contained\nin the same database and schema as the original notebook. Because of this, you cannot duplicate a notebook to move it to a different\ndatabase and schema, or to change ownership.",
        "To duplicate a notebook, complete the following steps:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "Select Projects \u00bb Notebooks.",
        "Open the notebook that you want to duplicate.",
        "Select the vertical ellipsis  menu, then select Duplicate.",
        "(Optional) Enter a name for the duplicate notebook, then select Duplicate.",
        "In the confirmation dialog, select Close to return to the original notebook, or Open notebook to open the duplicate\nnotebook.",
        "To open an existing notebook, follow these steps:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "Select Notebooks.",
        "Note",
        "Recently used notebooks also appear in Snowsight. Under Recently viewed, select Notebooks.",
        "Review the list of notebooks.",
        "You can see all notebooks owned by your active role or owned by a role inherited by your active role.",
        "Select a notebook to open it for editing.",
        "For details about editing notebooks, see Develop and run code in Snowflake Notebooks.",
        "When you open a notebook, you can see cached results from the last time you ran any cells in the notebook. The notebook is in the\nNot connected state by default, but if you select that state or run any cell, your notebook connects to your virtual warehouse.",
