        "By default, the privileges required to create and manage shares are granted only to the ACCOUNTADMIN role, ensuring that only account\nadministrators can perform these tasks. However, the privileges can also be granted to other roles, enabling the tasks to be delegated to\nother users in the account.",
        "For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see Creating custom roles.",

        "Data providers can choose either of the following options to add objects to a share:",
        "Option 1: Create a database role in a database, grant privileges on objects to the database role, and then grant the database role to\nthe share.",
        "Option 2: Grant privileges on the database and database objects directly to the share.",
        "For more information on these options, see How to share database objects.",

        "Granting CREATE SHARE to other roles makes managing shares more flexible, but also allows users with these roles to expose any objects\nthey own (or on which they have the necessary privileges) to other accounts. This is particularly important to note if you are sharing\ndata from an account that contains sensitive or proprietary data.",

        "Note",
        "Ownership of a share, as well as the objects in the share, may be either through a direct grant to the role or inherited from a\nlower-level role in the role hierarchy. For more details, see\nRole hierarchy and privilege inheritance.",
        "It is possible for the same role to own a share and the objects in the share.",
