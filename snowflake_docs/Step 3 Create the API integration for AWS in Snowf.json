        "This topic provides instructions for creating an API integration object in Snowflake to work with your proxy service (i.e.\nAmazon API Gateway). The instructions are the same regardless of whether you are using the Management Console or the\nCloudFormation template.",
        "Step 2: Create the proxy service (Amazon API Gateway) in the AWS Management Console",
        "Step 2: Record the Amazon API Gateway URL and the new IAM role ARN",
        "You need the following information to create the API integration for AWS in Snowflake:",
        "The New IAM Role ARN (from your tracking worksheet).",
        "The Resource Invocation URL (from your tracking worksheet).",
        "Open a Snowflake session, typically a Snowflake web interface session.",
        "Use a Snowflake role with ACCOUNTADMIN privileges or the CREATE INTEGRATION privilege, for example:",
        "Type the CREATE API INTEGRATION command to create an API integration. The command should\nlook similar to the following:",
        "Customize the command:",
        "The api_provider clause should be set based on the type of endpoint:",
        "If you are using a private endpoint, the api_provider clause should be set to\naws_private_api_gateway.",
        "If you are using a U.S. government GovCloud endpoint, the api_provider clause should be set to\naws_gov_api_gateway or aws_gov_private_api_gateway.",
        "For most other users, the api_provider clause should be set to aws_api_gateway.",
        "The <new_IAM_role_ARN> should be the value in the New IAM Role ARN field in the tracking worksheet.",
        "The api_allowed_prefixes field should contain the resource invocation URL that you recorded earlier.",
        "Below is an example of a complete CREATE API INTEGRATION statement:",
        "In the tracking worksheet field titled API Integration Name, record the name of the API integration\nthat you created. You need the API integration name when you execute the\nCREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION command later.",
        "Execute the CREATE API INTEGRATION command you typed above.",
        "Execute the DESCRIBE INTEGRATION command.",
        "For example:",
        "Look for the property named API_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN and then record that property\u2019s property_value in the\ntracking worksheet.",
        "Find the property named API_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID and record that property\u2019s property_value in the tracking worksheet.",
        "Note that the property_value of the API_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID often ends with an equals sign (\u201c=\u201d). That equals sign is\npart of the value; make sure that you cut and paste it along with the rest of the property_value.",
        "For the next few steps, you return to your AWS administration window. Do not close your Snowflake\nadministration window now; you must return to it later.",
