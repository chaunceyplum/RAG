        "This behavior change is in the 2023_04 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "For a JavaScript UDTF with an empty OVER clause, the behavior of the grouping of input rows is as follows:",
        "In a JavaScript UDTF with an empty OVER clause, input is partitioned as if the OVER clause is absent. In contrast, documentation states that\ninput rows belong to a single partition.",
        "JavaScript Table function input rows will be grouped into a single partition. This is as previously documented.",
        "To discover impact from this change, confirm whether you\u2019ve used a JavaScript UDTF with an explicit empty OVER clause and whether the results\nhave more per-partition rows than you expect (there should be one or zero such rows).",
