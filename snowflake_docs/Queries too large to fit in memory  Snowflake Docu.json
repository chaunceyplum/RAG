        "This topic discusses how a warehouse owner or administrator can resolve memory spillage in order to improve the performance of a query.",
        "Performance degrades drastically when a warehouse runs out of memory while executing a query because memory bytes must \u201cspill\u201d onto local\ndisk storage. If the query requires even more memory, it spills onto remote cloud-provider storage, which results in even worse performance.",
