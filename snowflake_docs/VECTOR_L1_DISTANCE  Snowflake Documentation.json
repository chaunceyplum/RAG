        "L1 distance, also known as the Taxicab or Manhattan distance, is a measure of\nthe distance between two points in a vector space. The distance is calculated by\ntaking the sum of the absolute value of the differences of vector elements. The\nresult is a value of zero or higher. If the distance is zero, the vectors\nare identical. The larger the distance, the farther apart the vectors are.",
