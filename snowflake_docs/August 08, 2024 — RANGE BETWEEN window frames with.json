        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of RANGE BETWEEN window frames with explicit\noffsets. A range-based window frame consists of a logically computed set of rows. By using a range-based frame with\nexplicit offsets, such as RANGE BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 3 FOLLOWING, you can easily compute rolling\ncalculations, such as moving sums and averages, over time-series data. Because of the range-based frame, these\ncalculations are not disrupted by gaps in the data set.",
