        "Enabling a resource is used to start ingesting data for a given resource.\nPUBLIC.ENABLE_RESOURCE procedure is the entry point from the UI or worksheet to enable a resource.\nIt can be used after a resource was disabled or when a resource was created as disabled and now it is needed to enable it.",
        "Calling this procedure requires the user has been assigned  the ADMIN application role.\nPhases are:",
        "Initial validation",
        "Custom validation",
        "Custom logic before a resource is enabled",
        "Marking a resource ingestion definition as enabled and creating new ingestion processes",
        "Custom logic after a resource is created",
        "Initial validation is performed at the very beginning of the enable resource process, and checks:",
        "whether a resource with given id exists",
        "whether a resource with given id is already enabled",
        "When a resource is already enabled, nothing is done and success response is returned.",
        "Custom validation is executed after initial validation, and is designed to be support customized connector-specific logic.\nFor example, it can be used to verify that a given resource still exists in a source system.",
        "By default, it invokes PUBLIC.ENABLE_RESOURCE_VALIDATE(resource_ingestion_definition_id),\nwhich returns 'response_code': 'OK'. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using\na EnableResourceHandlerBuilder to provide custom implementation of the EnableResourceValidator interface.",
        "If the custom validation returns error, the next steps will not be executed and given error response will be returned from ENABLE_RESOURCE procedure.",
        "Custom logic can be specified and executed before a resource is enabled.",
        "By default, it invokes PUBLIC.PRE_ENABLE_RESOURCE(resource_ingestion_definition_id VARCHAR),\nwhich returns 'response_code': 'OK'. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using\na EnableResourceHandlerBuilder to provide custom implementation of the PreEnableResourceCallback interface.",
        "If custom logic returns error, following steps will not be executed and an error response will be returned from ENABLE_RESOURCE procedure.",
        "Within this step the resource ingestion definition\u2019s enabled flag is changed to true and then\na new ingestion process is created for each ingestion configuration.\nIngestion processes are created with SCHEDULED status which means that the ingestion will start a while later.\nWhen a new ingestion process is being created, the metadata column is inherited from the last finished process with given ingestion configuration id.",
        "Custom logic can be defined to be executed after a resource is enabled.",
        "By default, it invokes PUBLIC.POST_ENABLE_RESOURCE(resource_ingestion_definition_id VARCHAR),\nwhich returns 'response_code': 'OK'. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using\na EnableResourceHandlerBuilder to provide custom implementation of the PostEnableResourceCallback interface.",
        "If custom logic returns error, given error response will be returned from ENABLE_RESOURCE procedure but\nthe process marking a resource ingestion definition as enabled and creating new ingestion processes will not be rolled back.",
