        "Added support for AWS VPCE deployments by adding the S3_STAGE_VPCE_DNS_NAME configuration parameter to specifying the\nVPCE DNS name at the session level.",
        "Added a new configuration option treat_decimal_as_long to enable the Spark Connector to return Long values\ninstead of BigDecimal values, if the query returns Decimal(<any_precision>, 0). WARNING: If the value is\ngreater than the maximum value of Long, an error will be raised.",
        "Added a new option proxy_protocol for specifying the proxy protocol (http or https) with AWS deployments.\n(The option has no effect on Azure and GCP deployments.).",
        "Added support for counting rows in a table where the row count is greater than the maximum value of Integer.",

        "Note",
        "Starting from version 2.11.0, the Snowflake Connector for Spark supports Spark 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.\nVersion 2.11.0 of the Snowflake Connector for Spark does not support Spark 3.0. Note that previous versions of the connector continue to support Spark 3.0.",
        "For Snowflake GCP accounts, the Snowflake JDBC driver versions 3.13.16 through 3.13.21 do not work with the Spark connector.",
        "Compatible JDBC Driver version: 3.13.14",

        "Added support for using the JDBC data type TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE when reading data from Snowflake.",
        "Changed the logic for checking for the existence of a table before saving a DataFrame to Snowflake:",
        "The connector now reuses the existing connection (rather than creating a new connection) to avoid potential problems with token expiration.",
        "If the table name is not fully qualified (i.e. does not include the schema name), the connector now checks for the table under the schema specified by sfSchema, rather than the schema that is currently in use in the session.",
        "Note",
        "If you need to save a DataFrame to a table in a schema other than sfSchema, specify the schema as part of\nthe fully qualified name of the table, rather than executing USE SCHEMA to change the current schema.",
        "Improved performance by avoiding unnecessary parse_json() calls in the COPY INTO TABLE command when writing a\nDataFrame with ArrayType, MapType, or StructType columns to Snowflake.",
        "Added the getLastSelectQueryId and getLastCopyLoadQueryId methods to the Utils class. These methods\nreturn the query ID of the last query that read data from Snowflake and the last COPY INTO TABLE statement that\nwas executed (respectively).",
        "Compatible JDBC Driver version: 3.13.14",
        "Added support for Spark, version 3.2. Beginning with this release, the Snowflake Connector for Spark only supports Spark 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2. Spark version 2.4 is no longer supported.",
