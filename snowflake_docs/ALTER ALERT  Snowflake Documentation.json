        "Modifies the properties of an existing alert and suspends or resumes an existing alert.",
        "CREATE ALERT , DESCRIBE ALERT, DROP ALERT , SHOW ALERTS , EXECUTE ALERT",
        "Identifier for the alert to alter. If the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire string must be enclosed\nin double quotes. Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "Specifies the action to perform on the alert:",
        "RESUME makes a suspended alert active.",
        "SUSPEND puts the alert into a \u201cSuspended\u201d state.",
        "If the alert schedule is set to an interval (i.e. num MINUTE), then to avoid ambiguity, the base interval time for\nthe schedule is reset to the current time when the alert is resumed.",
        "The base interval time starts the interval counter from the current clock time. For example, if an alert is created with\n10 MINUTE  and the alert is resumed at 9:03 AM, then the alert runs at 9:13 AM, 9:23 AM, and so on. Note that we make a best\neffort to ensure absolute precision, but only guarantee that alerts do not execute before their set interval occurs\n(e.g., in the current example, the alert could first run at 9:14 AM, but will definitely not run at 9:12 AM).",
        "Specifies one (or more) properties to set for the alert (separated by blank spaces, commas, or new lines).",
        "Specifies the virtual warehouse that provides compute resources for executing this alert.",
        "For serverless alerts, do not set this property.",
        "Specifies the schedule for periodically evaluating the condition for the alert.",
        "You can specify the schedule in one of the following ways:",
        "USING CRON expr time_zone",
        "Specifies a cron expression and time zone for periodically evaluating the condition for the alert. Supports a subset of\nstandard cron utility syntax.",
        "The cron expression consists of the following fields:",
        "The following special characters are supported:",
        "Special Character",
        "Description",
        "*",
        "Wildcard. When specified for a given field, the alert runs at every unit of time for that field.",
        "For example, * in the month field specifies that the alert runs every month.",
        "L",
        "Stands for \u201clast\u201d. When used in the day-of-week field, it allows you to specify constructs such as \u201cthe last Friday\u201d\n(\u201c5L\u201d) of a given month. In the day-of-month field, it specifies the last day of the month.",
        "/n",
        "Indicates the nth instance of a given unit of time. Each quanta of time is computed independently.",
        "For example, if 4/3 is specified in the month field, then the evaluation of the condition is scheduled for April,\nJuly and October (i.e. every 3 months, starting with the 4th month of the year).",
        "The same schedule is maintained in subsequent years. That is, the condition is not scheduled to be evaluated in January\n(3 months after the October run).",
        "Note",
        "The cron expression currently evaluates against the specified time zone only. Altering the\nTIMEZONE parameter value for the account (or setting the value at the user or session level) does not\nchange the time zone for the alert.",
        "The cron expression defines all valid times for the evaluation of the condition for the alert. Snowflake attempts\nto evaluate the condition based on this schedule; however, any valid run time is skipped if a previous run has not\ncompleted before the next valid run time starts.",
        "When both a specific day of month and day of week are included in the cron expression, then the evaluation of the\ncondition is scheduled on days satisfying either the day of month or day of week. For example,\nSCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 0 10-20 * TUE,THU UTC' schedules an evaluation at 0AM on any 10th to 20th day of the month\nand also on any Tuesday or Thursday outside of those dates.",
        "num MINUTE",
        "Specifies an interval (in minutes) of wait time inserted between evaluations of the alert. Accepts positive integers only.",
        "Also supports num M syntax.",
        "To avoid ambiguity, a base interval time is set when the alert is resumed (using\nALTER ALERT \u2026 RESUME).",
        "The base interval time starts the interval counter from the current clock time. For example, if an alert is created with\n10 MINUTE and the alert is resumed at 9:03 AM, then the condition for the alert is evaluated at 9:13 AM, 9:23 AM, and so\non. Note that we make a best effort to ensure absolute precision, but only guarantee that conditions are not evaluated\nbefore their set interval occurs (e.g. in the current example, the condition could be evaluated first at 9:14 AM but\ndefinitely not at 9:12 AM).",
        "Note",
        "The maximum supported value is 11520 (8 days). Alerts that have a greater num MINUTE value never have their\nconditions evaluated.",
        "Specifies a comment for the alert.",
        "Specifies the tag name and the tag string value.",
        "The tag value is always a string, and the maximum number of characters for the tag value is 256.",
        "For information about specifying tags in a statement, see Tag quotas for objects and columns.",
        "Specifies one or more properties/parameters to unset for the alert, which resets them back to their defaults:",
        "WAREHOUSE",
        "COMMENT",
        "TAG tag_key [ , tag_key ... ]",
        "Specifies the SQL statement that should represent the condition for the alert. You can use the following commands:",
        "SELECT",
        "SHOW <objects>",
        "CALL",
        "If the statement returns one or more rows, the action for the alert is executed.",
        "Specifies the SQL statement that should be executed if the condition returns one or more rows.",
        "To send a notification, you can\ncall the SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL or SYSTEM$SEND_SNOWFLAKE_NOTIFICATION stored procedure.",
        "Executing this SQL command requires roles with the following\nprivileges at a minimum:",
        "To resume an alert:",
        "The role executing ALTER ALERT must have either the OPERATE or OWNERSHIP privilege on the alert.",
        "The role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the alert must also have the following privileges:",
        "The global EXECUTE ALERT privilege.",
        "The global EXECUTE MANAGED ALERT privilege, if the alert is a serverless alert.",
        "The USAGE privilege on the warehouse, if the alert uses a specified warehouse.",

        "To modify the properties of the alert, the role executing ALTER ALERT must have the OWNERSHIP privilege on the alert.",
        "The USAGE privilege on the parent database and schema are required to perform operations on any object in a schema.",
        "For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see Creating custom roles.",
        "For general information about roles and privilege grants for performing SQL actions on\nsecurable objects, see Overview of Access Control.",
        "When an alert is resumed, Snowflake verifies that the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the alert also has the USAGE\nprivilege on the warehouse assigned to the alert, as well as the global EXECUTE ALERT privilege; if not, an error is produced.",
        "Only account administrators (users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) can grant the EXECUTE ALERT privilege to a role. For ease of use,\nwe recommend creating a custom role (e.g. alert_admin) and assigning the EXECUTE ALERT privilege to this role. Any role that can\ngrant privileges (e.g. SECURITYADMIN or any role with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege) can then grant this custom role to any alert\nowner role to allow altering their own alerts. For instructions for creating custom roles and role hierarchies, see\nConfiguring access control.",
        "When you execute CREATE ALERT or ALTER ALERT, some validation checks are not performed on the statements in the condition and\naction, including:",
        "The resolution of the identifiers for objects.",
        "The resolution of the data types of expressions.",
        "The verification of the number and types of arguments in a function call.",
        "The CREATE ALERT and ALTER ALERT commands do not fail if the SQL statement for a condition or action specifies an invalid\nidentifier, incorrect data type, incorrect number and types of function arguments, etc. Instead, the failure occurs when the\nalert executes.",
        "To check for failures in an existing alert, use the ALERT_HISTORY table function.",
        "To avoid these types of failures, before you specify the conditions and actions for alerts, verify the SQL expressions and\nstatements for those conditions and actions.",
        "Regarding metadata:",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
