        "The data contained in metadata fields may be processed outside of your Snowflake Region. It is your responsibility to ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered into any metadata field when using the Snowflake Service.",
        "When creating an object in Snowflake, metadata fields may be captured. The most common metadata fields are:",
        "Object definitions, such as a policy, an external function, or a view definition.",
        "Object properties, such as an object name or an object comment.",
        "Attention",
        "For objects defined through SQL, metadata fields are usually populated by any fields entered as part of CREATE <object>,\nand ALTER <object>, or method call statements for a given object. Creating or manipulating objects in other languages,\nsuch as Python, may also populate metadata fields based on the object\u2019s definitions and properties.",
