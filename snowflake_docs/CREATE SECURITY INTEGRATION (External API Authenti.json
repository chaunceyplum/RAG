        "In addition, the identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless\nthe entire identifier string is enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \u201cMy object\u201d). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also\ncase-sensitive.",

        "Specifies the client ID for the OAuth application in the external service.",

        "Specifies the default lifetime of the OAuth access token (in seconds) issued by an OAuth server.",
        "The value set in this property is used if the access token lifetime is not returned as part of OAuth token response. When both\nvalues are available, the smaller of the two values will be used to refresh the access token.",
