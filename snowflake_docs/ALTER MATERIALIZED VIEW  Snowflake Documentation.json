        "Specifies the identifier of the materialized view to alter.",
        "This option allows you to rename a materialized view.",
        "The new identifier must be unique for the schema in which the view is created.\nThe new identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier string\nis enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.\nFor more details, see Identifier requirements.",
        "You can move the object to a different database and/or schema while optionally renaming the object. To do so, specify\na qualified new_name value that includes the new database and/or schema name in the form\ndb_name.schema_name.object_name or schema_name.object_name, respectively.",
        "Note",
        "The destination database and/or schema must already exist. In addition, an object with the same name cannot already\nexist in the new location; otherwise, the statement returns an error.",
        "Moving an object to a managed access schema is prohibited unless the object owner (that is, the role that has\nthe OWNERSHIP privilege on the object) also owns the target schema.",
        "Note that renaming a materialized view does not update references to that view. For example, if\nyou create a view named V1 on top of a materialized view, and then you rename\nthe materialized view, the definition of view V1 becomes out of date.",
        "This command clusters the materialized view. Clustering\nre-orders the rows in the materialized view to increase performance for queries\nthat filter based on the clustering key expressions.",
        "The expr# specifies an expression on which to cluster the materialized view.\nTypically, each expression is the name of a column in the materialized view.",
        "For more information about clustering materialized views, see:\nMaterialized Views and Clustering.\nFor more information about clustering in general, see:\nWhat is Data Clustering?.",
        "This command drops the clustering of the materialized view.",
        "The SUSPEND RECLUSTER option suspends re-clustering of the materialized\nview. For more information about clustering materialized views,\nsee Materialized Views and Clustering.",
        "The RESUME RECLUSTER option resumes reclustering of the materialized\nview.",
        "The SUSPEND option suspends the maintenance (updates) and use of the\nmaterialized view. While the view is suspended, updates to the base table are\nnot propagated to the materialized view. The materialized view itself is\nalso inaccessible; if you attempt to use it, you get an error message\nsimilar to:",
        "If you suspend a clustered materialized view, suspending the view implicitly\nsuspends reclustering of that view.",
        "The RESUME option allows you to resume using the materialized view.\nIt also resumes maintenance of the materialized view.\nIf the view is clustered, it also implicitly resumes reclustering of that view.",
        "Specifies the property to set for the materialized view:",
        "This option turns the view into a secure view. For more information about secure views, see\nWorking with Secure Views.",
        "This option sets a comment for the materialized view. The comment has no effect on the behavior of the view,\nbut can provide useful information to people who use or maintain the view.",
        "Specifies the schedule to run the data metric function periodically.",
        "Specifies an interval (in minutes) of wait time inserted between runs of the data metric function. Accepts positive integers only.",
        "Also supports num M syntax.",
        "For data metric functions, use one of the following values: 5, 15, 30, 60, 720, or 1440.",
        "Specifies a cron expression and time zone for periodically running the data metric function. Supports a subset of standard cron\nutility syntax.",
        "For a list of time zones, see the list of tz database time zones.",
        "The cron expression consists of the following fields, and the periodic interval must be at least 5 minutes:",
        "The following special characters are supported:",
        "Wildcard. Specifies any occurrence of the field.",
        "Stands for \u201clast\u201d. When used in the day-of-week field, it allows you to specify constructs such as \u201cthe last Friday\u201d (\u201c5L\u201d) of\na given month. In the day-of-month field, it specifies the last day of the month.",
        "Indicates the nth instance of a given unit of time. Each quanta of time is computed independently. For example, if 4/3 is\nspecified in the month field, then the data metric function is scheduled for April, July and October (i.e. every 3 months, starting\nwith the 4th month of the year). The same schedule is maintained in subsequent years. That is, the data metric function is\nnot scheduled to run in January (3 months after the October run).",
        "Note",
        "The cron expression currently evaluates against the specified time zone only. Altering the TIMEZONE parameter value\nfor the account (or setting the value at the user or session level) does not change the time zone for the data metric\nfunction.",
        "The cron expression defines all valid run times for the data metric function. Snowflake attempts to run a data metric\nfunction based on this schedule; however, any valid run time is skipped if a previous run has not completed before the next valid\nrun time starts.",
        "When both a specific day of month and day of week are included in the cron expression, then the data metric function is scheduled\non days satisfying either the day of month or day of week. For example,\nDATA_METRIC_SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 0 10-20 * TUE,THU UTC' schedules a data metric function at 0AM on any 10th to 20th\nday of the month and also on any Tuesday or Thursday outside of those dates.",
