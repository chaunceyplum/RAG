        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "Generally available in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) commercial regions.",
        "Snowflake Notebooks is a unified development interface in Snowsight that offers an interactive, cell-based programming environment for Python, SQL, and Markdown.\nIn Snowflake Notebooks, you can leverage your Snowflake data to perform exploratory data analysis, develop machine learning models, and perform other data science and\ndata engineering workflows, all within the same interface.",
        "Explore and experiment with data already in Snowflake, or upload new data to Snowflake from local files, external cloud storage, or\ndatasets from the Snowflake Marketplace.",
        "Write SQL or Python code and quickly compare results with cell-by-cell development and execution.",
        "Interactively visualize your data using embedded Streamlit visualizations and other libraries like Altair, Matplotlib, or seaborn.",
        "Integrate with Git to collaborate with effective version control. See Sync Snowflake Notebooks with a Git repository.",
        "Contextualize results and make notes about different results with Markdown cells and charts.",
        "Run your notebook on a schedule to automate pipelines. See Schedule your Snowflake Notebook to run.",
        "Make use of the role-based access control and other data governance functionality available in Snowflake to allow other users\nwith the same role to view and collaborate on the notebook.",
        "Create a private notebook stored in your personal database, where you can develop code interactively and experiment with production data\nassets. See Private notebooks.",
        "Snowflake Notebooks offers two types of runtimes: warehouse runtime and container runtime. Notebooks rely on virtual warehouses and/or Snowpark Container Services\ncompute pools to provide the compute resource. For both architectures, SQL and Snowpark queries are always pushed down to execute on the\nwarehouse for optimized performance.",
        "The warehouse runtime gives you the fastest way to start, with a familiar warehouse environment that is generally available. The container\nruntime provides a more flexible environment that can support many different types of workloads, including SQL analytics and data\nengineering. You can install additional Python packages if the container runtime doesn\u2019t include what you need by default. Container\nruntime also comes in CPU and GPU versions that have many popular ML packages pre-installed, making them ideal for ML and deep learning\nworkloads.",
        "The following table shows supported features for each type of runtime. You can use this table to help decide which runtime is the right\nchoice for your use case.",
