        "In addition to letting you change your password, log out of the interface, and perform other, session-related tasks, the dropdown menu next to your login name lets you manage your user preferences,\nwhich includes:",
        "Enrolling in MFA.",
        "Validating your email address and specifying your notification preferences (if you are an account administrator). Notifications are used to inform account administrators that a credit quota threshold\nfor a resource monitor has been reached. For more details, see Working with resource monitors.",

        "MFA is a built-in Snowflake feature (available for all Snowflake Editions) that provides an additional level of user login security by requiring a second form of authentication (in addition to your\nstandard credentials) to log into Snowflake. This second form of authentication is provided by the Duo Mobile application, which you must install on a smart phone or similar device.",
        "By default, MFA is not enabled for individual Snowflake users. If you wish to use MFA for more secure login, you must enroll using the Snowflake web interface.",
        "To enroll in MFA using the Classic Console:",
        "Select Preferences from the dropdown menu next to your login name. The Preferences page appears:",
        "Click the Enroll in MFA link and follow the instructions provided in the wizard. Enrollment requires a smart phone with a valid phone number and the Duo Mobile application installed.",
        "Once enrolled, each time you attempt to log into Snowflake, either through the web interface or a command line client (e.g. SnowSQL), you will be prompted to enter your required user credentials (login name\nand password) and then you will need to provide the temporary authentication token/passcode generated by the Duo Mobile application. For more information, see Multi-factor authentication (MFA).",
        "Important",
        "If you are unable to log into Snowflake due to an MFA issue (e.g. you don\u2019t have access to your phone), please contact one of your account administrators. They can temporarily disable MFA, so that you can\nlog in, or they can disable MFA for you, which effectively cancels your enrollment.",
        "Once you enroll in MFA, you cannot use the web interface to unenroll. Rather, an account administrator must use a SQL command to\ntemporarily or permanently disable MFA for you. For details, see Managing MFA for an account and users.",
