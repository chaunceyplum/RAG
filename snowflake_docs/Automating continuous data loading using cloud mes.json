        "Automated data loads leverage event notifications for cloud storage to inform Snowpipe of the arrival of new data files to load. Snowpipe\ncopies the files into a queue, from which they are loaded into the target table in a continuous, serverless fashion based on parameters\ndefined in a specified pipe object.",
        "Note",
        "Automated Snowpipe uses event notifications to determine when new files arrive in monitored cloud storage and are ready to load. Notifications identify the cloud storage event and include a list of the file names. They do not include the actual data in the files.",
        "When a pipe is paused, event messages received for the pipe enter a limited retention period. The period is 14 days by default. If a\npipe is paused for longer than 14 days, it is considered stale.",
        "Event notifications received while a pipe is paused are retained for only a limited period of time (14 days). As each notification\nreaches the end of this period, Snowflake schedules it to be dropped from the internal metadata. If the pipe is later resumed,\nSnowpipe may process notifications older than 14 days on a best effort basis. Snowflake cannot guarantee that these older\nnotifications are processed.",
        "For information about resuming stale pipes, see Managing Snowpipe.",
