        "Also referred to as advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and \u201cBig Data\u201d, machine learning and data science cover a broad\ncategory of vendors, tools, and technologies that provide advanced capabilities for statistical and predictive modeling.",
        "These tools and technologies often share some overlapping features and functionality with BI tools;\nhowever, they focus less on analyzing/reporting past data. Instead, they focus on examining large data sets to discover patterns and\nuncover useful business information that can be used to predict future trends.",
