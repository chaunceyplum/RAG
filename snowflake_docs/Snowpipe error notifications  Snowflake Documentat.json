        "Snowpipe error notifications only work when the ON_ERROR copy option is set to SKIP_FILE (the default). Snowpipe will not send any error notifications if the ON_ERROR copy option is set to CONTINUE.",
        "You can use the NOTIFICATION_HISTORY table function to query the history of notifications sent through Snowpipe. For more information, refer to NOTIFICATION_HISTORY.",
