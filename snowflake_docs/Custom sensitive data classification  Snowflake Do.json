        "Snowflake provides the CUSTOM_CLASSIFIER class in the SNOWFLAKE.DATA_PRIVACY schema to\nenable data engineers to extend their data classification capabilities based on their own knowledge of their data. After you create an\ninstance of the class, you can call a method on the instance to define your own semantic category, specify the privacy category, and\nspecify regular expressions to match column value patterns while optionally matching the column name.",

        "Snowflake uses an algorithm that is unique for custom classification compared to the algorithm for\nData Classification. The reason for having different classification algorithms is to\nensure stable results depending on how you choose to classify your data.",
        "The custom classification algorithm uses a scoring rule to determine which semantic category system tag to recommend and which semantic\ncategory tags, if any, to suggest as alternatives. The scoring logic evaluates the regular expressions that you add to your instance, which\nyou specify by calling the custom_classifier!ADD_REGEX method on your instance.",
        "The scoring rule uses a default threshold value of 0.8 that equates to high confidence in terms of what the recommended tag should\nbe. Eighty percent of the data in the sample must match the regular expressions that you add to the instance. The algorithm compares the\nscore for a column against the threshold value and recommends a tag that corresponds to one of the following:",
