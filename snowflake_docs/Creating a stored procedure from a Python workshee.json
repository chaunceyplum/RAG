        "For example, you might write code in a Python worksheet that extracts data from stages or database objects in Snowflake, transforms the\ndata, then stores the transformed data in Snowflake. You could then deploy that code as a stored procedure and build a data pipeline,\nall without leaving Snowflake.",
