        "The DECOMPRESS_BINARY function can decompress data that was\noriginally in string format. However, the output of DECOMPRESS_BINARY\nis still BINARY, not string. For example,\nSELECT DECOMPRESS_BINARY(COMPRESS('Hello', 'SNAPPY), 'SNAPPY') returns a\nBINARY value; if you display that value, it is shown as\n48656C6C6F, which is the hexadecimal representation of \u2018Hello\u2019.\nTo avoid confusion, Snowflake recommends decompressing string data\nby using DECOMPRESS_STRING rather than DECOMPRESS_BINARY.",
