        "Standard & Business Critical Feature",
        "Database and share replication are available to all accounts.",
        "Replication of other account objects & failover/failback require Business Critical Edition (or higher).\nTo inquire about upgrading, please contact Snowflake Support.",
        "Charges based on replication are divided into two categories: data transfer and compute resources. Both categories are billed on the\ntarget account (i.e. the account that stores the secondary database or secondary replication/failover group that is refreshed).",
        "The initial replication and subsequent synchronization operations transfer data between regions. Cloud providers charge for\ndata transferred from one region to another within their own network.",
        "The data transfer rate is determined by the location of the source account (i.e. the account that stores the primary replication\nor failover group). For data transfer pricing, see the Snowflake Service Consumption Table.",
        "For more information, see Understanding data transfer cost.",
        "Replication operations use Snowflake-provided compute resources for the following:",
        "To determine the delta of both metadata and data to be copied during the refresh operation.",
        "To copy the data between accounts across regions.",
        "The service type for compute costs for replication in the account usage and\norganization usage views is REPLICATION.",
        "For more information, see Understanding compute cost.",
        "Note",
        "The target account also incurs standard storage costs for the data in each secondary database in the account.",
        "The target account also incurs costs for the automatic background processes that service\nmaterialized views\nand search optimization. The maintenance costs for secondary objects\nis lower than for primary objects. For details, see the \u201cServerless Feature Credit Table\u201d in the\nSnowflake Service Consumption Table for the costs per compute hour.",
        "Replication charges are applied even if the initial replication or a refresh operation doesn\u2019t succeed. Any data that is copied\nbefore the initial replication or refresh operation fails can be reused by a subsequent refresh operation (if performed within 14 days)\nand doesn\u2019t need to be copied again.",
        "In this Topic:",
        "In general, monthly billing for replication is proportional to:",
        "Amount of table data in the primary database, or databases in a replication/failover group, that changes as a result of data loading\nor DML operations.",
        "Frequency of secondary database, or replication/failover group, refreshes from the primary database or replication/failover group.",
        "You can control the cost of replication by carefully choosing which databases or objects to replicate and their refresh frequency. You\ncan stop incurring replication costs by ceasing refresh operations.",
        "Users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can use SQL to view the amount of data transferred (in bytes) and the credit usage for\nreplication using replication or failover groups for your Snowflake account within a specified date range.",
        "To view the data transfer amounts and credit usage for replication for your account:",
        "Query either of the following:",
        "REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY table function (in the Snowflake Information Schema). This\nfunction returns replication usage activity within the last 14 days.",
        "REPLICATION_GROUP_USAGE_HISTORY view (in Account Usage). This view returns\nreplication usage activity within the last 365 days (1 year).",
