        "Note",
        "These considerations also apply for creating a listing in a remote region.",
        "Since the data is shared between different accounts, data consumers should be able to use shared data objects without using double-quoted identifiers (see Identifier requirements). As a result, object identifiers for tables, columns, and share names must be upper case and use only alphanumeric characters.",
        "To ensure that your sensitive data in a shared database is not exposed to users in consumer accounts, see Use secure objects to control data access.",
        "Shares that are currently shared with a consumer account (i.e. via a direct share) can be added to a listing. Consumers must accept the listing terms in a Data Exchange web interface before they can create a database from the share.",
        "Only the role that created the share can attach the share to a listing.",
        "A share can only be attached to one listing. If a share has already been attached to a listing, it cannot be attached to another listing, even if the listing has been deleted.",
        "Before a new or modified free listing can be published, all sample queries are auto-validated to ensure that referenced objects are added to the share and the queries can be run successfully.",
        "The data must be legally shareable (i.e. the provider must own the data or have the right to share it).",
        "Note",
        "To the extent any data in your data listing or data set is governed by any laws or contractual obligations, you must ensure that you have the legal and contractual rights to share such data. For example, you can only share protected health information (PHI) through a personalized data share and, to do so, you must: (1) have signed a business associate agreement (BAA) with Snowflake and the Consumer receiving the PHI, and; (2) ensure that the Consumer has also signed a BAA with Snowflake. Also, while you can share personal data through a data share, to do so you must have the applicable legal and contractual rights if the data is not publicly available.",
        "When you publish a listing, consumers will see your listing in all selected regions.",
        "While listings are automatically replicated, the data is not.",
        "For free listings, you must replicate data to each of the selected regions before publishing the listing.",
        "For personalized listings, you can replicate data upon consumer\u2019s request.",
        "Make sure to allocate time to set up replication and understand costs involved.",
        "To share data in a region, you must have an account in that region in order to replicate data. If you have more than one account, all accounts must belong to the same organization.",
        "When you publish a listing in a remote region, you can either allow all accounts in your organization to fulfill listing requests or explicitly add individual accounts as providers. Only the listing owner can specify who can fulfill listing requests.",
        "Cross region data sharing utilizes Snowflake data replication functionality, for more information, see Share data securely across regions and cloud platforms.",
        "You do not need to replicate the data to each region until a consumer requests it.",
        "For free listings, you have an option to pre-associate a share with the listing in a remote region. This will allow consumers to get the share instantly without submitting a request.",
        "To see a list of shares attached to a listing in a remote region, you must log in to the remote account from which you attached the share to the listing.",
