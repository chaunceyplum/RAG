        "This topic describes how an AWS administrator in your organization can explicitly grant Snowflake access to your AWS S3 storage account (i.e. your buckets and the objects in those buckets). The process involves allowing the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) IDs for your Snowflake account.",
