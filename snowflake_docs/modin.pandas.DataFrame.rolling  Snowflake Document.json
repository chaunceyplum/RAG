        "Provide rolling window calculations.\nCurrently, support is only provided for integer window, axis = 0, and min_periods = 1.",
        "window (int, timedelta, str, offset, or BaseIndexer subclass. Size of the moving window.) \u2013 If an integer, the fixed number of observations used for each window.\nIf a timedelta, str, or offset, the time period of each window. Each window will be a variable sized based on the observations included in the time-period. This is only valid for datetimelike indexes.\nIf a BaseIndexer subclass, the window boundaries based on the defined get_window_bounds method. Additional rolling keyword arguments, namely min_periods, center, closed and step will be passed to get_window_bounds.",
        "min_periods (int, default None.) \u2013 Minimum number of observations in window required to have a value; otherwise, result is np.nan.\nFor a window that is specified by an offset, min_periods will default to 1.\nFor a window that is specified by an integer, min_periods will default to the size of the window.",
        "center (bool, default False.) \u2013 If False, set the window labels as the right edge of the window index.\nIf True, set the window labels as the center of the window index.",
        "win_type (str, default None) \u2013 If None, all points are evenly weighted.\nIf a string, it must be a valid scipy.signal window function.\nCertain Scipy window types require additional parameters to be passed in the aggregation function. The additional parameters must match the keywords specified in the Scipy window type method signature.",
        "on (str, optional) \u2013 For a DataFrame, a column label or Index level on which to calculate the rolling window, rather than the DataFrame\u2019s index.\nProvided integer column is ignored and excluded from result since an integer index is not used to calculate the rolling window.",
        "axis (int or str, default 0) \u2013 If 0 or \u2018index\u2019, roll across the rows.\nIf 1 or \u2018columns\u2019, roll across the columns.\nFor Series this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.",
        "closed (str, default None) \u2013 If \u2018right\u2019, the first point in the window is excluded from calculations.\nIf \u2018left\u2019, the last point in the window is excluded from calculations.\nIf \u2018both\u2019, the no points in the window are excluded from calculations.\nIf \u2018neither\u2019, the first and last points in the window are excluded from calculations.\nDefault None (\u2018right\u2019).",
        "step (int, default None) \u2013 Evaluate the window at every step result, equivalent to slicing as [::step]. window must be an integer. Using a step argument other than None or 1 will produce a result with a different shape than the input.",
        "method (str {\u2018single\u2019, \u2018table\u2019}, default \u2018single\u2019) \u2013 This parameter is ignored in Snowpark pandas since the execution engine will always be Snowflake.",
