        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the ability to track the chain of queries that call a stored procedure by using the\nparent_query_id and root_query_id columns. These columns allow you to see the query ID that performs a read or write\noperation on another object, and the query ID for the query that calls a stored procedure, respectively. The columns support calling a\nstored procedure directly and nested stored procedure calls, such as when one stored procedure calls another stored procedure.",
