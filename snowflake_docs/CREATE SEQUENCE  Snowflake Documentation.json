        "Creates a new sequence, which can be used for generating sequential, unique numbers.",
        "Important",
        "Snowflake does not guarantee generating sequence numbers without gaps. The generated numbers are not necessarily contiguous.",
        "For more details, see Using Sequences.",
        "DROP SEQUENCE , ALTER SEQUENCE , SHOW SEQUENCES , DESCRIBE SEQUENCE",
        "Specifies the identifier for the sequence; must be unique for the schema in which the sequence is created.",
        "In addition, the identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the\nentire identifier string is enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also\ncase-sensitive.",
        "For more details about identifiers, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Specifies the first value returned by the sequence. Supported values are any value that can be represented by a 64-bit two\u2019s\ncomplement integer (from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1).",
        "Default: 1",
        "Specifies the step interval of the sequence:",
        "For positive sequence interval n, the next n-1 values are reserved by each sequence call.",
        "For negative sequence interval -n, the next n-1 lower values are reserved by each sequence call.",
        "Supported values are any non-zero value that can be represented by a 64-bit two\u2019s complement integer.",
        "Default: 1",
        "Specifies whether or not the values are generated for the sequence in\nincreasing or decreasing order.",
        "ORDER specifies that the values generated for a sequence or auto-incremented column are in increasing order (or, if the interval\nis a negative value, in decreasing order).",
        "For example, if a sequence or auto-incremented column has START 1 INCREMENT 2, the generated values might be\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.",
        "NOORDER specifies that the values are not guaranteed to be in increasing order.",
        "For example, if a sequence has START 1 INCREMENT 2, the generated values might be 1, 3, 101, 5, 103, etc.",
        "NOORDER can improve performance when multiple INSERT operations are performed concurrently (for example, when multiple\nclients are executing multiple INSERT statements).",
        "Default: The NOORDER_SEQUENCE_AS_DEFAULT parameter determines which property is set by default.",
        "Specifies a comment for the sequence.",
        "Default: No value",
        "A role used to execute this SQL command must have the following\nprivileges at a minimum:",
        "Privilege",
        "Object",
        "Notes",
        "CREATE SEQUENCE",
        "Schema",
        "The USAGE privilege on the parent database and schema are required to perform operations on any object in a schema.",
        "For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see Creating custom roles.",
        "For general information about roles and privilege grants for performing SQL actions on\nsecurable objects, see Overview of Access Control.",
        "The first/initial value for a sequence cannot be changed after the sequence is created.",
        "A sequence does not necessarily produce a gap-free sequence. Values increase (until the limit is reached) and are unique,\nbut are not necessarily contiguous. For more information, including the upper and lower limits, see Sequence Semantics.",
        "Regarding metadata:",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
        "CREATE OR REPLACE <object> statements are atomic. That is, when an object is replaced, the old object is deleted and the new object is created in a single transaction.",
        "Here is a simple example of using sequences:",
        "Run the same query again; note how the sequence numbers change:",
        "Now use the sequence while inserting into a table:",
        "Create a sequence that increments by 5 rather than by 1:",
        "Run the same query again; note how the sequence numbers change. You might expect that the next set of sequence numbers would start 5\nhigher than the previous statement left off. However, the next sequence number starts 20 higher (5 * 4, where 5 is the size of the\nincrement and 4 is the number of NEXTVAL operations in the statement):",
        "This example demonstrates that you can use a sequence as a default value for a column to provide unique identifiers for each row in\na table:",
        "This query shows that each row in the table has a distinct value:",
        "More examples are available in Using Sequences.",
