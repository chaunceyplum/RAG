        "Preview Feature \u2014 Open",
        "Metrics data collection is a preview feature available to all accounts.",
        "For example, you might see No Metrics Data on the Related Metrics panel under Query History > Query Telemetry. Or your\nevent table queries for data return no results. There\u2019s a good chance this is due to telemetry not being fully enabled. To learn more, see\nEnabling telemetry collection.",
        "To troubleshoot, confirm the following:",
        "Your account has an active event table and that the table is the one you\u2019re checking for data.",
        "For more information, see Event table overview.",
        "The default level for the data you\u2019re looking for (logging, metrics, or tracing) is set to a value that allows data to be recorded.",
        "For more information, see Setting levels for logging, metrics, and tracing.",
        "You are setting the levels for logs, traces, and metrics high enough at runtime.",
        "For example, although you might have set the level for each when you enabled telemetry collection,\nyou might be overriding those levels for individual objects. For more information on setting and overriding levels, see\nSetting levels for logging, metrics, and tracing.",
        "You have installed the telemetry package you need for your handler language. These packages should be added to the PACKAGES statement of\nyour UDF or stored procedure, or added to your Streamlit with the Packages dropdown.",

        "For Java and Scala: com.snowflake.telemetry",
        "The type of object from which you want to collect data supports emitting telemetry data. For information about language support for\ntypes of telemetry data, see the following topics on supported languages:",
        "For logging",
        "For metrics",
        "For tracing",
        "The event table has not been truncated.",
        "For more information, see TRUNCATE TABLE.",
        "You have raw data in the event table.",
        "If your queries of the event table return data but you don\u2019t see the data in Snowsight, ensure that you\u2019ve chosen a warehouse\nin Snowsight.",
        "Metrics: If your queries of the event table return no data, ensure that the duration of the procedure or UDF execution for which you\nwant to collect data is longer than the metrics collection interval. Short-running jobs may not emit any metrics data.",
        "For information about the role time plays in metrics data collection, see Metrics limitations.",
        "Remember that the data might not yet be in the event table.",
        "For example, it might take longer due to latency. It can take up to 5 minutes for the metrics data to be available in the event table\nand in Snowsight.",
        "You can query the event table for raw data as described in the following topics:",
