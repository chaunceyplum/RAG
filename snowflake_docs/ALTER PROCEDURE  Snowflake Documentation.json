        "Specifies the data type of the argument(s) for the stored procedure, if it has arguments. The argument types are required because stored\nprocedures support name overloading (i.e. two stored procedures in the same schema can have the same name) and the argument types are used to\nidentify the procedure you wish to alter.",
        "Specifies the new identifier for the stored procedure; the combination of the identifier and existing argument data types must be unique for\nthe schema.",
