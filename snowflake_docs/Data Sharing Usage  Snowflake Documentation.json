By default, only account administrators (users with\nthe ACCOUNTADMIN role) in the account can access the SNOWFLAKE database and schemas within the database, or perform queries on the\nviews; however, privileges on the database can be granted to other roles in your account to allow other users to access the objects.\nFor more details, see Enabling other roles to use schemas in the SNOWFLAKE database.",
