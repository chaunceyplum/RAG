        "When you pass a wildcard to the function, you can qualify the wildcard with the name or alias for the table.\nFor example, to pass in all of the columns from the table named mytable, specify the following:",

        "ILIKE filters for column names that match the specified pattern. Only one\npattern is allowed. For example:",
