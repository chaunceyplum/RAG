        "Apply modifications to a running service. For example, suspend or resume a service, and update the number of service instances\nrunning.",
        "Apply modifications that take effect only after service is restarted. For example, specify a default warehouse for queries.",
        "Apply modifications that cause Snowflake to shut down the service, and restart using new code. For example, you might want to\ndeploy updated service code.",

        "Specifies whether to suspend or resume the service.",
        "When you suspend a service, Snowflake shuts down and deletes the containers. If you later resume a suspended service,Snowflake\nrecreates the containers. That is, Snowflake takes the image from your repository and starts the containers. Note that, Snowflake deploys the same image version; it is not a service update operation.",
        "When you invoke a suspended service using either a service function or invoking the public endpoint (ingress), Snowflake\nautomatically resumes the service.",

        "Specifies the file containing the service specification template or the service specification template inline. If your service specification template is in a file, use SPECIFICATION_TEMPLATE_FILE. For services created in a Snowflake Native App, omit @stage, and specify a path relative to the app root directory. For services created in other contexts, specify the Snowflake internal stage and path to the service specification file. When using template specification, you should also include the USING parameter.",

        "key is the name of the template variable. The template variable name can optionally be enclosed in double quotes\n(\").",

        "Specifies the minimum number of service instances.",
        "Specifies the maximum number of service instances.",

        "If you want to use the SHOW SERVICES or DESCRIBE SERVICE command to find the MIN_READY_INSTANCES configured for the service you must enable the 2024_08 behavior change bundle in your account.\nTo enable this bundle in your account, execute the following statement:",

        "If AUTO_RESUME is FALSE, you need to explicitly resume the service (using ALTER SERVICE \u2026 RESUME).",
        "Specifies the names of the external access integrations that allow your service to access external sites.\nSnowflake replaces all the existing EAIs with those specified in this parameter.\nThe names in this list are case-sensitive. For more information, see Configuring network egress.\nNote that this changes the allowed network access for all running instances of the service. You don\u2019t need to explicitly suspend and resume the service.",
        "Specifies a comment for the compute pool.",
