        "The native application has been migrated to the new event-sharing model. Telemetry sharing is now mandatory for all event types, such as logs and traces, and it can\u2019t be disabled for the new installations.

        "The connector supports column types that are not listed in the pg_type table.",
        "Stopped printing the warning in the agent: \u201cJAXB is unavailable. Will fallback to SDK implementation which may be less performant\u201d.",
        "Stopped printing the warning in the agent: \u201cUnable to load native-hadoop library for your platform\u2026 using builtin-java classes where applicable\u201d.",

        "The PUBLIC.REMOVE_TABLES(DATA_SOURCE_NAME STRING, SCHEMA_NAME STRING, TABLE_NAMES ARRAY) procedure enables the removal of multiple tables with one call.",
        "The operational warehouse will now correctly suspend when all data sources are switched to a scheduled mode.",
        "The agent will no longer restart when the logging rate is too high.",
        "Fixed failing table replication on PostgreSQL numerics NaN, Infinity, -Infinity by ingesting them as null.",

        "You can now configure the agent through environment properties in addition to using snowflake.json and datasources.json for configuration.",
        "You can now pass the private key contents through the snowflake.private-key property or SNOWFLAKE_PRIVATEKEY environment variable.",
        "For more information, see Configure and run the agent.",
        "When schema introspection fails the operational warehouse suspends in the scheduled mode.",
        "Fixed a bug where some commands to stop table replication were ignored in a few cases.",
