        "If the INVOKER_SHARE function is used inside a User-defined functions overview within a masking policy directly attached to a table or view, INVOKER_SHARE returns NULL because the context of the INVOKER_SHARE function is the UDF owner, not the share.",
        "To help determine if a table or view was directly or indirectly invoked by a share, consider using the CURRENT_ACCOUNT function in a masking policy. This function returns the Snowflake account for the user\u2019s current session, which can help determine if the table or view is invoked from a data sharing consumer account.",
        "Consider a data sharing provider account that has a masking policy set on a column of a secure view. There are two different shares that\ncan access the secure view to support two different data sharing consumers.",
        "The data sharing provider creates the following policy to use UDFs to identify which share is being accessed. If a user in the data sharing\nconsumer account attempts to query the data through either share, they see data based on how the UDFs are written, otherwise a fixed masked\nvalue is seen.",
