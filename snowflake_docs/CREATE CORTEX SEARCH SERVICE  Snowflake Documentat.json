    "paragraphs": [
        "Creates a new Cortex Search service or replaces an existing one.",
        "String that specifies the identifier (i.e. name) for the Cortex Search service; must be unique for the schema in which the service is created.",
        "In addition, the identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the\nentire identifier string is enclosed in double quotes (for example, \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also\ncase-sensitive.",
        "For more information, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Specifies the text column in the base table that you wish to search on. This column must be a text value.",
        "Specifies comma-separated list of columns in the base table that you wish to filter on when issuing queries to the service.\nAttribute columns must be included in the source query, either via explicit enumeration or wildcard, ( * ).",
        "Specifies the warehouse to use for running the source query, building the search index, and keeping it refreshed per the TARGET_LAG target.",
        "Specifies the maximum amount of time that the Cortex Search service content should lag behind updates to the base tables specified in the source query.",
        "Optional parameter that specifies the embedding model to use in the Cortex Search Service. This property cannot be altered after you create the Cortex\nSearch Service. To modify the property, recreate the Cortex Search Service with a CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE command.",
        "Some embedding models are only available in certain cloud regions for Cortex Search.\nFor an availability list by model by region, see\nCortex Search Regional Availability.",
        "Each model may incur a different cost per million input tokens processed.\nRefer to the Snowflake Service Consumption Table for each function\u2019s cost in credits per million tokens.",
        "If the EMBEDDING_MODEL is not specified, the default model is used. The default model is snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5.",
        "Specifies a comment for the service.",
        "Specifies a query defining the base table from which the service is created.",
        "A role used to execute this SQL command must have the following\nprivileges at a minimum:",
        "Privilege",
        "Object",
        "CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE",
        "Schema in which you plan to create the search service.",
        "SELECT",
        "Tables, and views that you plan to query for the new service.",
        "USAGE",
        "Warehouse that you plan to use to refresh the service.",
        "The USAGE privilege on the parent database and schema are required to perform operations on any object in a schema.",
        "For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see Creating custom roles.",
        "For general information about roles and privilege grants for performing SQL actions on\nsecurable objects, see Overview of Access Control.",
        "Attention",
        "To create a Cortex Search Service, your role must have the same privileges required to use Cortex LLM Functions.\nSee Cortex LLM Functions Required Privileges.",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
        "CREATE OR REPLACE <object> statements are atomic. That is, when an object is replaced, the old object is deleted and the new object is created in a single transaction.",
        "The size of the Warehouse used to run the Cortex Search service source query does impact the speed and cost of each refresh. A\nlarger warehouse decreases build and refresh time. However, during this preview, Snowflake recommends using a warehouse size no larger\nthan MEDIUM for Cortex Search services.",
        "Snowflake recommends using a dedicated warehouse for each Cortex Search service so as to not interfere with other workloads.",
        "The search index is built as part of the create statement, which means the CREATE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE statement may take longer to\ncomplete for larger datasets.",
        "The following example creates a Cortex Search service named mysvc:",
