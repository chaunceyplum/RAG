        "Lists all access control privileges that have been explicitly granted to roles, users, and shares.",

        "Note",
        "SHOW GRANTS is a special variation that uses different syntax from all the other SHOW <objects> commands.",
        "Syntactically equivalent to SHOW GRANTS TO USER current_user. Lists all the roles granted to the current user.",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned. The actual number of rows returned might be less than the specified limit. For\nexample, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output).",
        "Lists all the account-level (i.e. global) privileges that have been granted to roles.",
        "Lists all privileges that have been granted on the object.",
        "For database roles, you can use the fully qualified name, database_name.database_role_name, or the relative name,\ndatabase_role_name. If you use the relative name for the database role, Snowflake uses the database in session to resolve the\nrelative name of the database role.",
        "Lists all the privileges and roles granted to the application.",
        "Lists all the privileges and roles granted to the application role.",
        "The name of the application, app_name, is optional. If not specified, Snowflake uses the current application. If the\napplication is not a database, this command does not return results.",
        "Lists the service endpoints for which the service role is granted the USAGE privilege.",
        "Lists all the privileges and roles granted to the instance role.",
        "If the database and schema that contains the class_name is not in use or is not specified in\nyour search path, specify the fully-qualified name of the class. For example,\nSNOWFLAKE.CORE.BUDGET.",
        "For details, see the instance role example.",
        "Lists all privileges and roles granted to the role. If the role has a grant on a temporary object, then the grant only exists in the\nsession that the temporary object was created.",
        "Lists all the privileges granted to the share.",
        "Lists all of the privileges and roles granted to a share in the application package.",
        "Lists all the roles granted to the user. Note that the PUBLIC role, which is automatically available to every user, is not listed.",
        "Lists all the users and roles to which the application role has been granted.",
        "The name of the application, app_name, is optional. If not specified, Snowflake uses the current application. If the\napplication is not a database, this command does not return results.",
        "Lists all the users and roles to which the service role has been granted.",
        "Lists all users and roles to which the role has been granted.",
        "Lists all the accounts that are consuming the share. Accounts that have not yet consumed the share are excluded.\nTo see all accounts that have been added to a share, query the SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.SHARES view.",
        "Lists all privileges on new (i.e. future) objects of a specified type in the schema granted to a role. database_name. specifies the database in which the schema resides and is optional when querying a schema in the current database.",
        "Lists all privileges on new (i.e. future) objects of a specified type in the database granted to a role.",
        "Lists all privileges on new (i.e. future) objects of a specified type in a database or schema granted to the role.",
        "Lists all privileges on new (i.e. future) objects of a specified type in a database or schema granted to the database role.",
        "A shared database role does not support future grants. For details, see the usage notes in the GRANT DATABASE ROLE \u2026 TO SHARE command.",
        "The granted_by column indicates the role that authorized a privilege grant to the grantee. The authorization role is known as the\ngrantor.",
        "When you grant privileges on an object to a role using GRANT <privileges>, the following authorization rules\ndetermine which role is listed as the grantor of the privilege:",
        "If an active role is the object owner (i.e. has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the\nobject), that role is the grantor.",
        "If an active role holds the specified permission with the grant option authorized (i.e., the privilege was granted to the active role\nwith the GRANT <privileges> \u2026 TO ROLE <role_name> WITH GRANT OPTION, where <role_name> is one of the active roles). If so, the\nrole that holds the privilege with the grant option authorized is the grantor role. Note that if multiple active roles meet this\ncriterion, it is non-deterministic which of the roles becomes the grantor role.",
        "If an active role holds the global MANAGE GRANTS privilege, the grantor role is the object owner, not the role that held the\nMANAGE GRANTS privilege. That is, the MANAGE GRANTS privilege allows a role to impersonate the object owner for the purposes of\ngranting privileges on that object.",
        "If the granted_by column is empty, the privilege was granted by the Snowflake SYSTEM role. Certain internal operations are\nperformed with this role. Grants of privileges authorized by the SYSTEM role cannot be modified by customers.",
        "When using the SHOW GRANTS \u2026 TO SHARE IN APPLICATION PACKAGE syntax:",
        "The grantee_name column specifies the name of the application package.",
        "The granted_to column specifies APPLICATION PACKAGE SHARE.",
        "The granted_by_role_type column specifies the type of grantor role that performed the grant: ROLE, DATABASE_ROLE, or\nAPPLICATION_ROLE. This column only appears in the output when using the SHOW GRANTS ON syntax.",
        "A data sharing consumer can only view the privileges on objects that are granted to the share, such as\nSELECT on a table. Depending on how the grants are set up, the output of a SHOW GRANTS command that is run by the consumer might show\nempty values for shared objects in the following columns: granted_to, grantee_name, granted_by_role_type, and\ngranted_by. For example:",
        "If an account role owns the shared object, the consumer cannot view the OWNERSHIP privilege on shared objects because the consumer\ncannot access (resolve) the role that owns the object (account roles are not shared).",
        "If a database role owns the shared object and the provider shares the database role, the consumer can view the OWNERSHIP privilege on\nthe shared object because they can resolve the shared database role.",
        "The grant_options column returns FALSE when you run a SHOW GRANTS ON <object_type> <object_name> command for an object in the\nmanaged access schema.",
        "The privilege column includes the OWNERSHIP and MANAGE GRANTS privileges for the role that owns the managed access schema when\nyou run a SHOW GRANTS ON SCHEMA <managed_access_schema> command.",
        "With database roles and the SHOW FUTURE GRANTS TO DATABASE ROLE syntax, the command returns results for database roles that are not\ngranted to a share.",
        "In the data sharing consumer account, this command does not return any rows when a shared database role is granted future\nprivileges. However, depending on your account and the timing of support for future privileges to database roles in this command, you\nmight see this error message:",
        "As the consumer, ask the provider to revoke the future grants from the shared database role.",
        "The command does not require a running warehouse to execute.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",
