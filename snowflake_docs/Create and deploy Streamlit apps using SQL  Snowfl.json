        "This topic describes how to deploy a Streamlit app in Snowflake by using SQL commands. It describes\nhow to deploy single-page and multi-page Streamlit apps.",
        "Before creating a Streamlit app by using SQL, ensure that you meet the required prerequisites.",
        "To create a Streamlit app in Snowflake by using SQL commands, perform each of the following tasks:",
        "Create the Streamlit files on your local file system",
        "Upload your Streamlit files to a named stage",
        "Create a STREAMLIT object",
        "View a Streamlit app",
        "This section describes how to create a single-page or multi-page Streamlit app.",
        "On your local file system,\ncreate your main Streamlit app.",
        "Optional: If you are creating a\nmulti-page Streamlit app,\ncreate a folder called pages on your local file system, and then add the additional Streamlit pages\nto this subfolder.",
        "Optional: To include external packages in your Streamlit app, create an\nenvironment.yml file. For information about including\nexternal packages, see Manage packages by using the environment.yml file.",
        "After you create the Streamlit pages, your directory structure should look similar to this:",
        "Note",
        "The environment.yml file and the optional pages subfolder must be at the same level as your main Streamlit file. Any additional Streamlit\npages must be included within the pages subfolder.",
        "To create a Streamlit app in Streamlit in Snowflake, you must upload your application files to a named stage.",
        "To upload application files, do one of the following:",
        "Upload the application files by using Snowsight, as described in\nStaging files using Snowsight.",
        "Upload the application files by using SnowSQL, as shown in the following example:",
        "A STREAMLIT object is a database object in Snowflake that encapsulates the files required by your Streamlit app.",
        "To create a STREAMLIT object, run the CREATE STREAMLIT command, as shown in the following example:",
        "This command creates a STREAMLIT object named hello_streamlit based on the path and file specified\nin ROOT_LOCATION and MAIN_FILE.",
        "Note",
        "Although the QUERY_WAREHOUSE clause is optional, you must specify a query warehouse to be able to run\nthe Streamlit app in Snowflake.",
        "To verify that the Streamlit object was created, run the SHOW STREAMLITS command:",
        "To install additional Python packages in your Streamlit app:",
        "Create an environment.yml file on your local file system.",
        "To upload the file to the stage location specified by\nthe ROOT_LOCATION parameter of the STREAMLIT object, run the PUT command.",
        "Packages listed in the environment.yml are installed from the\nSnowflake Anaconda Channel.",
        "The following sample environment.yml shows how to install scikit-learn within the Streamlit environment:",
        "The name and channels properties are required. Also, the - snowflake key is required under the\nchannels property.",
        "Note",
        "You can only install packages listed in the\nSnowflake Anaconda Channel.\nStreamlit in Snowflake does not support external Anaconda channels.",
        "To pin the Streamlit version in the environment.yml file, include a streamlit dependency as shown in the following example:",
        "To view information about the STREAMLIT object, run the DESCRIBE STREAMLIT command, as shown in the following example:",
        "To view your Streamlit app in Snowsight, see View a Streamlit app.",
        "After creating a STREAMLIT object, use the ALTER STREAMLIT command to modify\ndifferent properties as described in the following sections.",
        "To rename a STREAMLIT object, use the RENAME TO clause of the ALTER STREAMLIT command, as shown in the following example:",
        "To change the path to the stage for a STREAMLIT object, use the ALTER STREAMLIT command to set the ROOT_LOCATION property of the object, as shown in the following example:",
        "To change the main Streamlit file in a STREAMLIT object, use the ALTER STREAMLIT command to set the MAIN_FILE property of the object, as shown in the following example:",
        "To add a query warehouse or change the current query warehouse for a STREAMLIT object, use the ALTER STREAMLIT command to set the QUERY_WAREHOUSE property of the object, as shown in the following example:",
        "To list the Streamlit apps that are available to your current role, run the SHOW STREAMLITS command, as shown in the following example:",
        "To delete a STREAMLIT object, run the DROP STREAMLIT command, as shown in the following example:",
