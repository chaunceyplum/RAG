        "Update the application code and related files.",
        "Before running the automated security scan, ensure that the app conforms to the security\nrequirements and best practices outline in Security requirements and best practices for a Snowflake Native App. If the app is\na Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services, review the additional security requirements outlined in Secure a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services.",
        "Add a version or patch to the application package.",
        "Run the automated security scan. The automated security scan starts when the provider does one of the following:",
        "Adds a new version or patch to the application package when the DISTRIBUTION property is set to\nEXTERNAL. The new version is scanned automatically.",
        "Sets the DISTRIBUTION property to \u201cEXTERNAL\u201d on an application package that already has a version\ndefined. The ten most recent versions of the application package are scanned automatically. All\npatches for these version are also scanned.",

        "Marketplace listings.",
        "A provider can set the DISTRIBUTION property when creating the application package or afterwards.",
        "To set the DISTRIBUTION property when creating an application package, run the\nCREATE APPLICATION PACKAGE as shown in the following example:",
        "When a provider sets the DISTRIBUTION property when creating the application package, any versions or\npatches added to the application package later are scanned immediately.",
