        "The following new features, behavior changes, and updates (enhancements, fixes, etc.) have been introduced this month. If you have any\nquestions about these additions, please contact\nSnowflake Support.",
        "Important",
        "Each release may include updates that require the web interface to be refreshed.",
        "As a general practice, to ensure these updates do not impact your usage, we recommend refreshing the web interface after each Snowflake\nrelease has been deployed.",
        "With this release, Snowflake introduces password policies. A password policy is a new schema-level object that specifies the requirements\nthat must be met to create and reset passwords for authenticating to Snowflake. Snowflake allows setting a password policy for your\nSnowflake account, as well as a password policy for individual users in the account, where the user-level password policy takes precedence\nover the account-level password policy.",
        "Note that password policies apply only to new passwords in your Snowflake account. To ensure that a user\u2019s existing password meets the\nrequirements specified in a password policy, set the user property MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD to TRUE using an\nALTER USER statement.",
        "For details, see Password Policies.",
        "We are pleased to announce the general availability of the Snowpark API for Python.",
        "Snowpark is a new developer experience that provides an intuitive API for querying and processing data in a data pipeline. Using this\nlibrary, you can build applications that process data in Snowflake without moving data to the system where your application code runs.",
        "For more information, see Snowpark Developer Guide for Python.",
        "We are pleased to announce the general availability of Python UDFs (user-defined functions).",
        "Users can now write custom functions in the Python programming language and call those as though they were built-in functions.",
        "For more information, see Introduction to Python UDFs.",
        "We are pleased to announce the general availability of the Python UDF batch API.",
        "The Python UDF batch API enables defining Python functions that receive batches of input rows as Pandas DataFrames and return batches of\nresults as Pandas arrays or Series. Python UDFs that use the batch API are called the same way as other Python UDFs.",
        "For more information, see Vectorized Python UDFs.",
        "We are pleased to announce the general availability of Python UDTFs (user-defined table functions).",
        "Python UDTFs extend Snowflake\u2019s native development capabilities by combining the advantages of table functions with the power,\nflexibility, and ease of programming in Python.",
        "For more information, see Writing a UDTF in Python.",
        "We are pleased to announce the general availability of Snowpark stored procedures for Python, which allows you to write stored procedures\nin Python using the Snowpark API.",
        "In your stored procedure, you can use the Snowpark API for Python to host your data pipelines in Snowflake. For example, you can write\nstored procedures when you need to execute your Snowpark code without running a client application (e.g. from a task).",
        "For more information, see Writing stored procedures in Python.",
        "In a recent release, the PROCEDURES view was added to the account usage views (in the\nSNOWFLAKE shared database) to provide information about stored procedures. The PROCEDURES view displays one row for each stored\nprocedure in the account.",
        "We are pleased to announce a preview of support for tables with masking policies and row access policies in the search\noptimization service.",
        "Prior to the introduction of this feature, an error occurred if you attempted to add search optimization to a table that used\nmasking policies or row access policies. With this feature, you can improve the performance of queries on columns in that table.",
        "For more information, see Search Optimization Service.",
        "With this release, you can exclude or rename specific columns in a SELECT * statement.",
        "To exclude one or more columns, specify EXCLUDE with the names of the columns:",
        "To rename one or more columns, specify RENAME with the original names of the columns and the new names of the columns:",
        "You can use EXCLUDE and RENAME in the same statement. If you do, you must specify EXCLUDE before RENAME, and you cannot specify the same\ncolumn in both EXCLUDE and RENAME.",
        "For example, to select all columns except the employee_id column from employee_table and rename the\ndepartment_id column to department:",
        "For more information, see SELECT.",
        "The following function(s) were introduced in recent releases:",
        "Function Category",
        "New Function",
        "Description",
        "Semi-structured Data Functions (Array/Object)",
        "ARRAY_EXCEPT",
        "Returns a new ARRAY that contains the elements from one input ARRAY that are not in another input ARRAY.",
        "Numeric",
        "DIV0NULL",
        "Performs division like the division operator (/), but returns 0 when the divisor is 0 or NULL (rather than\nreporting an error or returning NULL).",
        "Semi-structured Data Functions (Array/Object)",
        "ARRAY_DISTINCT",
        "Returns a new ARRAY that contains only the distinct elements from the input ARRAY.",
        "We are pleased to announce a preview of the SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL() system stored procedure for sending email notifications. You can call this\nstored procedure to send an email notification from a task, your own stored procedure, or an interactive session.",
        "For more information, see Using SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL to send email notifications.",
        "With this release, a new table function, NOTIFICATION_HISTORY, has been added to the Snowflake Information Schema.",
        "This table function returns the history of notifications sent through Snowflake, including:",
        "Notifications from tasks.",
        "Notifications from Snowpipe.",
        "Email notifications.",
        "Note: This function only returns information about notifications that have been processed (notifications that were either sent out or have\nfailed). Notifications in the queue will not be shown in the history.",
        "For more information on this table function, see NOTIFICATION_HISTORY.",
        "With this release, a new view, LOCK_WAIT_HISTORY, has been added to the Account Usage schema in the Snowflake database.",
        "The LOCK_WAIT_HISTORY view returns transaction details that can be useful in analyzing blocked transactions.\nEach row in the output includes the details of a transaction that is waiting on a lock and the details of transactions that are holding\nthat lock or waiting ahead for that lock.",
        "For more information, see Analyzing blocked transactions with the LOCK_WAIT_HISTORY view.",
        "We are pleased to announce a preview of Snowpark-optimized warehouses in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud\nregions.",
        "For more information, see Snowpark-optimized warehouses.",
        "We are pleased to announce the general availability of request and response translators. This feature makes it easier to change the\nformat of data sent to, and received from, remote services used by external functions.",
        "This feature allows you to conveniently:",
        "Convert data from Snowflake\u2019s format to the remote service\u2019s native input format (request translator).",
        "Convert data from the remote service\u2019s native output format to Snowflake\u2019s format (response translator).",
        "For more information, see Using request and response translators with data for a remote service.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce support for UDFs, UDTFs, external functions, and stored procedures in the Account\nUsage ACCESS_HISTORY View.",
        "For details, see:",
        "Access History Usage Notes",
        "UDFs & Stored Procedures notes",
