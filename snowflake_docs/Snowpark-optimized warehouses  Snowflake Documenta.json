        "While Snowpark workloads can be run on both standard and Snowpark-optimized warehouses, Snowpark-optimized warehouses are recommended for\nrunning code, and recommended workloads that have large memory requirements or dependencies on a specific CPU architecture. Example workloads include ML training\nuse cases using a stored procedure on a single virtual warehouse\nnode. Snowpark workloads, utilizing UDF or\nUDTF, might also benefit from Snowpark-optimized warehouses.",
