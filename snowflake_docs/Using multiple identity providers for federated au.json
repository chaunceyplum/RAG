    "paragraphs": [
        "You can configure Snowflake to allow users to authenticate with multiple identity providers (IdPs).",
        "Implementing a federated environment that uses multiple IdPs consists of the following steps:",
        "Enable the identifier-first login flow (in this topic).",
        "Configure each identity provider.",
        "Create multiple SAML security integrations, one for each IdP.",
        "Associate users with IdPs (in this topic).",
        "Note",
        "Keep the following in mind as you implement an environment using multiple IdPs:",
        "Each IdP must have a corresponding SAML security integration. If you have an existing single-IdP environment that uses the deprecated\nSAML_IDENTITY_PROVIDER parameter, you must use the SYSTEM$MIGRATE_SAML_IDP_REGISTRATION function to\nmigrate it to a SAML security integration.",
        "Currently, only a subset of Snowflake drivers support the use of multiple identity providers. These drivers include JDBC, ODBC, and Python.",
        "When the federated environment for an account uses multiple IdPs, Snowflake must be able to determine which IdPs are associated with a user\nbefore presenting the user with authentication options. In this flow, Snowflake prompts the user for only their email address or username,\nthen displays authentication methods after identifying the user. Only IdPs associated with the user appear as authentication options.",
        "The identifier-first login flow must be enabled if you are using multiple IdPs. To enable identifier-first login, set the\nENABLE_IDENTIFIER_FIRST_LOGIN parameter to TRUE:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "In the navigation menu, select Projects \u00bb Worksheets.",
        "Execute the following SQL statements:",
        "For more information about the identifier-first login flow, see Identifier-first login.",
        "In an environment with multiple IdPs, you can choose how you want to associate a user with an IdP. You can use the security integration\nassociated with an IdP, an authentication policy, or combine the two methods.",
        "Use the ALLOWED_USER_DOMAINS and ALLOWED_EMAIL_PATTERNS properties of the SAML2 security integration associated with each\nIdP. In this configuration, a user only sees an IdP as an authentication option if their EMAIL matches an email address domain or\npattern in the security integration.",
        "Use the SECURITY_INTEGRATIONS property of an authentication policy to specify which\nsecurity integrations are available to the user. In this configuration, the authentication policy is assigned to an entire account or an\nindividual user. A user can only authenticate with IdPs associated with security integrations that are specified in the authentication\npolicy.",
        "If you want a user to only see the identity providers that they are allowed to use, create multiple authentication policies and then\nassign the appropriate policy to a user.",
        "For an example of using an authentication policy to implement multiple IdPs, see Allow authentication from multiple identity providers on an account.",
        "You can combine the security integration and authentication policy methods to further refine how users authenticate in an environment that\nhas multiple IdPs.",
        "If you use both methods, Snowflake first evaluates which security integrations are associated with the authentication policy governing the\nuser\u2019s login. Once Snowflake has identified the security integrations, the user\u2019s EMAIL is matched to one of the integrations\nbased on the ALLOWED_USER_DOMAINS and ALLOWED_EMAIL_PATTERNS properties. Snowflake only displays the IdP option for the\nsecurity integration that matches the user\u2019s EMAIL.",
        "This section guides you through configuring Snowflake and Microsoft Entra ID to let users authenticate through SSO using both a public or\nprivate issuer URL. You can use two different SAML2 security integrations with Microsoft Entra ID to implement this experience. You can\nconfigure Microsoft Entra ID to differentiate between public and private issuer URLs by appending a different application ID to each issuer\nURL.",
        "Before continuing, you must enable the identifier-first login flow.",
        "Follow the sections below to learn how to use multiple SAML2 security integrations with Microsoft Entra ID using the same issuer\nID:",
