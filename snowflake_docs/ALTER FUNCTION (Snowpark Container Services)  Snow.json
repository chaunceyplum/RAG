        "Modifies the properties of an existing service function.",

        "Service functions, CREATE FUNCTION, DESC FUNCTION, DROP FUNCTION",
        "Specifies the identifier for the service function to alter. The identifier can contain the schema name and database name, as well as the function name.\nIf the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire string must be enclosed in double quotes. Identifiers enclosed in\ndouble quotes are also case sensitive.",
        "Specifies the arguments/input data types for the service function.",
        "If the function accepts arguments, then the ALTER command must specify the argument types because functions support\nname overloading (that is, two functions in the same schema can have the same name), and the argument types are used to\nidentify the function.",
        "Specifies the new identifier for the service function; the combination of the identifier and existing argument data types must be unique for the schema.",
        "For more information, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Note",
        "When specifying the new name for the service function, do not specify argument data types or parentheses; specify only the new name.",
        "You can move the object to a different database and/or schema while optionally renaming the object. To do so, specify\na qualified new_name value that includes the new database and/or schema name in the form\ndb_name.schema_name.object_name or schema_name.object_name, respectively.",
        "Note",
        "The destination database and/or schema must already exist. In addition, an object with the same name cannot already\nexist in the new location; otherwise, the statement returns an error.",
        "Moving an object to a managed access schema is prohibited unless the object owner (that is, the role that has\nthe OWNERSHIP privilege on the object) also owns the target schema.",
        "When an object is renamed, other objects that reference it must be updated with the new name.",
        "Specifies the properties to set for the function:",
        "Specifies a comment for the function, which is displayed in the DESCRIPTION column in the SHOW FUNCTIONS and SHOW USER FUNCTIONS\noutput.",
        "Specifies the service name and the endpoint name as defined in the service specification.",
        "It allows binding Snowflake context function results to HTTP headers.",
        "Each value must be the name of a context function. Don\u2019t include quote marks around the names.",
        "More details about this parameter are in CREATE FUNCTION (Snowpark Container Services).",
        "Specifies the batch size when sending data to a service to increase concurrency",
        "Specifies the properties to unset for the function, which resets them to the defaults. Note that you can\u2019t unset the service endpoint.",
