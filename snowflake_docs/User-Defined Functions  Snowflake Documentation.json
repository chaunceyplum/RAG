        "User-defined functions (UDFs) in Snowpark. Please see Python UDFs for details.\nFurthermore, there is vectorized UDF (Please see Python UDF Batch API for details). Compared to the default row-by-row processing pattern of a normal UDF, which sometimes is\ninefficient, a vectorized UDF allows vectorized operations on a dataframe, with the input as a pandas DataFrame or pandas Series. In a\nvectorized UDF, you can operate on a batches of rows by handling pandas DataFrame or pandas Series.",
