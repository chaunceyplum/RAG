        "You can download the SnowSQL installer from the SnowSQL Download page. No authentication is required. This version of the\nSnowSQL installer enables auto-upgrade for patches.",
        "For more detailed instructions, see Installing SnowSQL.",
        "If Z shell (also known as zsh) is your default terminal shell, set an alias to the SnowSQL executable so that you can run SnowSQL on the command line in Terminal. The SnowSQL installer installs the executable in /Applications/SnowSQL.app/Contents/MacOS/snowsql and appends this path to the PATH or alias entry in ~/.profile. Because zsh does not normally read this file, add an alias to this path in ~/.zshrc, which zsh does read.",
        "To add an alias to the SnowSQL executable:",
        "Open (or create, if missing) the ~/.zshrc file.",
        "Add the following line:",
        "Save the file.",
        "From a terminal window, start SnowSQL from the command prompt using the following command:",

        "You can further streamline login by specifying the -u option followed by your user login name:",
        "When prompted, enter your login name (if you didn\u2019t provide it when executing SnowSQL) and your password.",
        "If you specified a valid account identifier, user login name, and password, the SnowSQL prompt appears.",
        "Tip",
        "For security reasons, you cannot specify your password as an option on the command line; you must wait for SnowSQL to prompt you for your password.",
        "However, if you would like to skip entering information on the command line or you need to automate login, you can provide all the required account and user credential information, as well as additional\nSnowflake default usage information, as options in the SnowSQL config file.",
        "For more detailed installation, configuration, login, and usage information, see SnowSQL (CLI client).",

        "Developing applications that connect through the Snowflake connectors/drivers for Python, Node.js, Spark, etc.",
        "However, connecting to Snowflake using these other methods requires additional installation, configuration, and development tasks. For more information, see Applications and tools for connecting to Snowflake.",
