        "This topic provides information on how sensitive data classification works.",
        "For information on how to use custom classifiers, see Custom sensitive data classification.",
        "Sensitive data classification is a multi-step process that associates Snowflake-defined system tags to columns by analyzing the fields and metadata for\npersonal data; this data can be tracked by a data engineer using SQL and Snowsight. A data engineer can classify columns in a\ntable to determine whether the column contains certain kinds of data that need to be tracked or protected, such a unique identifier\n(passport or bank account data), a quasi-identifier (the city in which the individual lives), or a sensitive value (the salary of an\nindividual).",
        "By tracking the data with a system tag and protecting the data by using a masking or row access policy, the data engineer can improve the\ngovernance posture associated with the data. The overall result of the classification and data protection steps is to facilitate compliance\nwith data privacy regulations.",
        "You can classify a single table or tables in a schema. Snowflake provides predefined system tags\nto enable you to classify and tag columns, or you can use custom classifiers to define your own semantic category based on your knowledge\nof your data. You can also choose an approach the uses Snowflake system tags and custom classifiers depending on the governance posture that\nyou wish to adopt.",
        "Classification provides the following benefits to data privacy and data governance administrators:",
        "The results of classifying column data can inform identity and access management administrators to evaluate and maintain their Snowflake\nrole hierarchies to ensure the Snowflake roles have the appropriate access to\nsensitive or PII data.",
        "The classification process can help to identify and confirm the storage location of PII data. Subsequently, a data sharing provider can\nuse the classification results to determine whether to share data and how to make the PII data available to a data sharing consumer.",
        "The usage of columns containing PII data, such as referencing columns in base tables to create a view or materialized view, can help to\ndetermine the best approach to protect the data with either a masking policy or a row access policy.",
        "System tags are tags that Snowflake creates, maintains, and makes available in the shared\nSNOWFLAKE database. There are two Classification system tags, both of which exist in the\nSNOWFLAKE.CORE schema:",
        "SNOWFLAKE.CORE.SEMANTIC_CATEGORY",
        "SNOWFLAKE.CORE.PRIVACY_CATEGORY",
        "The data engineer assigns these tags to a column containing personal or sensitive data.",
        "Snowflake stores the assignment of a system tag on a column as a key-value pair, where the value is a string. Snowflake defines the\nallowed string values for each classification system tag because Snowflake maintains each of these system tags.",
        "The tag names, SEMANTIC_CATEGORY and PRIVACY_CATEGORY, correspond to the Classification categories that Snowflake assigns\nto the column data during the column sampling process (i.e. the tag names and category names use the same words):",
        "The semantic category identifies personal attributes.",
        "A non-exhaustive list of personal attributes Classification supports include name, age, and gender. These three attributes are possible\nstring values when assigning the SEMANTIC_CATEGORY tag to a column.",
        "Classification can detect information from different countries, such as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. For example, if your\ntable column contains phone number information, the analysis process can differentiate the different phone number values from each of\nthese countries.",
        "If the analysis determines that the column data corresponds to a semantic category, Snowflake further classifies the column to a privacy\ncategory. The privacy category has three values: identifier, quasi-identifier, or sensitive. These three values are the string values that\ncan be specified when assigning the PRIVACY_CATEGORY Classification system tag to a column.",
        "Identifier: These attributes uniquely identify an individual. Example attributes include name, social security number, and phone number.",
        "Identifier attributes are synonymous with direct identifiers.",
        "Quasi-identifier: These attributes can uniquely identify an individual when two or more or these attributes are in\ncombination. Example attributes include age and gender.",
        "Quasi-identifiers are synonymous with indirect identifiers.",
        "Sensitive: These attributes are not considered enough to identify an individual but are information that the individual would rather not\ndisclose for privacy reasons.",
        "Currently, the only attribute that Snowflake evaluates as sensitive is salary.",
        "Insensitive: These attributes do not contain personal or sensitive information.",
        "The following table summarizes the relationship between each classification category and system tag, and the string values for each\nclassification system tag. Snowflake supports international SEMANTIC_CATEGORY tag values that pertain to certain countries. The country\ncodes are based on the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 standard. Other semantic categories, such\nas EMAIL and GENDER, do not have a country code. To track international information, the data engineer uses the value in the\nSEMANTIC_CATEGORY tag values column when setting a system tag on a column.",
