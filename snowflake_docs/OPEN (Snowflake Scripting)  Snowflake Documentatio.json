        "The result set of a query can be thought of as a set of rows. Internally, opening a cursor executes the query,\nreads the rows, and positions an internal pointer to the first of the rows.",
        "As with any SQL query, if the query definition does not contain an\nORDER BY at the outermost level, then the result\nset has no defined order. When the result set for the cursor is created, its order persists until the cursor is\nclosed. However, re-declaring or re-opening the cursor might produce the rows in a different order.",
        "Similarly, if a cursor is closed, and then the underlying table(s) are updated before it is re-opened, the\nresult set can also change.",
