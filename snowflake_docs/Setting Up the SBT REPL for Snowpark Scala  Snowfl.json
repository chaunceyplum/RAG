        "This topic explains how to set up the SBT REPL for Snowpark.",
        "Next, create a new Scala project for Snowpark.",
        "Create a new directory for your project, and change to that directory.",
        "Run the sbt new command, and specify the template\nthat you want to use to create the new project. For example:",
        "Enter a name for your project. This creates a project directory with that name.",
        "Next, configure the project for Snowpark.",
        "In the build.sbt file for your project, make the following changes:",
        "If the scalaVersion setting does not match the version that you plan to use, update the setting. For example:",
        "Note that you must use a\nScala version that is supported for use with the Snowpark library.",
        "Add the Snowpark library to the list of dependencies. For example:",
        "Add the following lines to configure the REPL:",
        "To verify that you have configured your project to use Snowpark, run a simple example of Snowpark code.",
        "In the src/main/scala/Main.scala file, replace the contents with the code below:",
        "Note the following:",
        "Replace the <placeholders> with values that you use to connect to Snowflake.",
        "For <account_identifier>, specify your account identifier.",
        "If you prefer to use key pair authentication:",
        "Replace PASSWORD with PRIVATE_KEY_FILE, and set it to the path to your private key file.",
        "If the private key is encrypted, you must set PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PWD to the passphrase for decrypting the private key.",
        "As an alternative to setting PRIVATE_KEY_FILE and PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PWD, you can set the PRIVATEKEY\nproperty to the string value of the unencrypted private key from the private key file.",
        "For example, if your private key file is unencrypted, set this to the value of the key in the file (without the\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END PRIVATE KEY----- header and footer and without the line endings).",
        "Note that if the private key is encrypted, you must decrypt the key before setting it as the value of the PRIVATEKEY\nproperty.",
        "If you plan to create UDFs:",
        "Don\u2019t set up your object to extend the App trait. For details, see\nCaveat About Creating UDFs in an Object With the App Trait.",
        "Don\u2019t set up your object to extend a class or trait that is not serializable.",
        "Change to your project directory, and run the following command to run the sample code:",
