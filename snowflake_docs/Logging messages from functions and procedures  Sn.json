        "You can log messages (such as warning or error messages) from a stored procedure, UDF, or UDTF, including those you write\nusing Snowpark APIs. You can access the logged messages from an event table (a type of\npredefined table that captures events, including logged messages). For a list of supported handler languages, see\nSupported languages.",
        "For example, in a Java UDF, you can use the SLF4J API to log messages. Later, you can access those logged messages in an event\ntable.",

        "Before you can collect log messages, you must enable telemetry data collection.\nWhen you instrument your code, Snowflake generates the data and collects it in an event table.",
        "The Python code in the following example imports the logging module, gets a logger, and logs a message at the INFO level.",
        "Note",
        "A message logged from a method that processes an input row will be logged for every row processed by the UDF. If the UDF is executed in a\nlarge table, this can result in a large number of messages in the event table.",
