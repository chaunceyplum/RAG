        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "Available to accounts in AWS and Microsoft Azure commercial regions, with some exceptions. For more information, see Available regions.",
        "The costs associated with using Snowpark Container Services can be categorized into storage cost, compute pool cost, and data\ntransfer cost.",
        "When you use Snowpark Container Services, storage costs associated with Snowflake, including the cost of Snowflake stage usage\nor database table storage, apply. For more information, see  Exploring storage cost. In addition, the\nfollowing cost considerations apply:",
        "Image repository storage cost: The implementation of the image repository uses\na Snowflake stage. Therefore, the associated cost for using the Snowflake stage applies.",
        "Log storage cost: When you store\nlocal container logs in event tables, event table storage\ncosts apply.",
        "Mounting volumes cost:",
        "When you mount a Snowflake stage as a volume, the cost of using the Snowflake stage applies.",
        "When you mount storage from the compute pool node as a volume, it appears as local storage in the container. But there is no\nadditional cost because the local storage cost is covered by the cost of the compute pool node.",
        "Block storage cost: When you create a service that uses block storage, you are billed for block storage and snapshot storage. For more information about storage pricing, see the Snowflake Service Consumption Table. The SPCS Block Storage Pricing  table in this document provides the information.",
        "A compute pool is a collection of one or more virtual machine (VM) nodes on which Snowflake\nruns your Snowpark Container Services jobs and services. The number and type (instance family) of the nodes in the compute pool\n(see CREATE COMPUTE POOL) determine the credits it consumes and thus the cost you pay.",
        "You incur charges for a compute pool in the IDLE, ACTIVE, STOPPING, or RESIZING state, but not when it is in a STARTING or\nSUSPENDED state. To optimize compute pool expenses, you should leverage the AUTO_SUSPEND feature (see CREATE COMPUTE POOL).\nFor more information, see the Snowflake Service Consumption Table.",
        "The following views provide usage information:",
        "ACCOUNT_USAGE views",
        "The following ACCOUNT_USAGE views contain Snowpark Container Services credit usage information:",
        "The SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES_HISTORY view offers\ncredit usage information (hourly consumption) exclusively for Snowpark Container Services.",
        "In the METERING_DAILY_HISTORY view, query for rows in which the\nservice_type column contains the value SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES.",
        "In the METERING_HISTORY view, query for rows in which the\nservice_type column contains the value SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES.",
        "ORGANIZATION_USAGE views",
        "In the METERING_DAILY_HISTORY view, use the\nSERVICE_TYPE = SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES query filter.",
        "Data transfer is the process of moving data into (ingress) and out of (egress) Snowflake. For more information, see\nUnderstanding data transfer cost. When you use Snowpark Container Services, the following additional cost\nconsiderations apply:",
        "Outbound data transfer: Snowflake applies the same data transfer rate for outbound data transfers from services and jobs\nto other cloud regions and to the internet, consistent with the rate for all Snowflake outbound data transfers. For more\ninformation, see the Snowflake Service Consumption Table (table 4a).",
        "You can query the DATA_TRANSFER_HISTORY ACCOUNT_USAGE view for\nusage information. The transfer_type column identifies this cost as the SNOWPARK_CONTAINER_SERVICES type.",
        "Internal data transfer: This class of data transfer refers to data movements across compute entities within Snowflake, such as\nbetween two compute pools or a compute pool and a warehouse, that resulted from executing a\nservice function.\nFor more information, see the Snowflake Service Consumption Table\n(tables 4(a) for AWS, 4(b) for Azure, and the column titled \u201cSPCS Data Transfer to Same Cloud Provider, Same Region\u201d).",
        "To view the costs associated with internal data transfer, you can do the following:",
        "Query the INTERNAL_DATA_TRANSFER_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema.",
        "Query the DATA_TRANSFER_HISTORY view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. The\ntransfer_type column identifies this cost as the INTERNAL type.",
        "Query the DATA_TRANSFER_HISTORY view in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema.\nThe transfer_type column identifies this cost as the INTERNAL type.",
        "Query the DATA_TRANSFER_DAILY_HISTORY view in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema. The service_type column identifies this cost as the INTERNAL_DATA_TRANSFER type.",
        "Query the RATE_SHEET_DAILY view in the ORGANIZATION USAGE\nschema. The service_type column identifies this cost as the INTERNAL_DATA_TRANSFER type.",
        "Query the USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY view in the ORGANIZATION USAGE\nschema. The service_type column identifies this cost as the INTERNAL_DATA_TRANSFER type.",
