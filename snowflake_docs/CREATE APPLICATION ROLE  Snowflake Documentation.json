        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "Creates a new application role or replaces an existing application role. Use application roles to\nenable access control security for objects within an application object.",
        "See About application roles for more information.",
        "Note",
        "Application roles are only valid within the context of an application object.",
        "When creating an application role, you can grant privileges on objects to the application role.\nWithin the setup script, you  can then grant the application role to other application roles.",
        "After installing a Snowflake Native App, consumers can grant application roles to account roles to\nenable access to the app.",
        "With application roles, you can grant privileges on other objects within the application or\nobjects owned by the application in the consumer account.",
        "Application roles are implicitly granted to the application owner WITH GRANT OPTION. The\napplication owner may grant these roles to account level roles, providing access to the\nobjects that are owned by the application.",
        "Additionally, this command supports the following variants:",
        "CREATE OR ALTER APPLICATION ROLE: Creates a new application role if it doesn\u2019t exist or\nalters an existing application role.",
        "ALTER APPLICATION ROLE, GRANT APPLICATION ROLE,\nREVOKE APPLICATION ROLE, SHOW APPLICATION ROLES, CREATE OR ALTER <object>",
        "Preview Feature \u2014 Open",
        "Available to all accounts.",
        "Creates a new application role if it doesn\u2019t already exist, or transforms an existing application role\ninto the role defined in the statement. A CREATE OR ALTER APPLICATION ROLE statement follows the syntax rules of a\nCREATE APPLICATION ROLE statement and has the same limitations as an ALTER APPLICATION ROLE\nstatement.",
        "For more information, see CREATE OR ALTER APPLICATION ROLE usage notes.",
        "Specifies the identifier for the application role. This value must be unique within the application object\nin which the role is created.",
        "The identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier\nstring is enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "If the identifier is not fully qualified, in the form of application_name.application_role_name, the command creates the\napplication role in the current application for the session.",
        "For more details, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Specifies a comment for the application role.",
        "Default: No value",
        "A role used to execute this SQL command must have the following\nprivileges at a minimum:",
        "Privilege",
        "Object",
        "Notes",
        "OWNERSHIP",
        "Application role",
        "Required to execute a CREATE OR ALTER APPLICATION ROLE statement for an existing application role.",
        "OWNERSHIP is a special privilege on an object that is automatically granted to the role that created the object, but can also be transferred using the GRANT OWNERSHIP command to a different role by the owning role (or any role with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege).",
        "For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see Creating custom roles.",
        "For general information about roles and privilege grants for performing SQL actions on\nsecurable objects, see Overview of Access Control.",
        "The maximum number of application roles that can be created in an application object is 1000.",
        "Regarding metadata:",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
        "CREATE OR REPLACE <object> statements are atomic. That is, when an object is replaced, the old object is deleted and the new object is created in a single transaction.",
        "Preview Feature \u2014 Open",
        "Available to all accounts.",
        "All limitations of the ALTER APPLICATION ROLE command apply.",
        "Setting or unsetting a tag is not supported; however, existing tags are not altered by a CREATE\nOR ALTER APPLICATION ROLE statement and remain unchanged.",
