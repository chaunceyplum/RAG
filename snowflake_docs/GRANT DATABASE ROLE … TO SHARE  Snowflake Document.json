        "Grants a database role to a share. Granting a database role effectively adds privileges on a single database to the share, which can then\nbe shared with one or more consumer accounts.",
        "After consumers create a database from the share, they can grant the shared database roles to roles in their account to allow users with\nthose roles to access database objects in the share.",

        "Specifies the identifier (i.e. name) for the database role; must be unique in the database in which the role is created.",
        "The identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier\nstring is enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "If the identifier is not fully qualified (in the form of db_name.database_role_name, the command looks for the database role\nin the current database for the session.",
        "Specifies the identifier for the share from which the specified database role is granted.",
        "Granting a database role to a share fails if any DDL or other restricted privilege was granted to the database role. A database role can\nonly grant permissions for read-only activity on a database and its objects.",
