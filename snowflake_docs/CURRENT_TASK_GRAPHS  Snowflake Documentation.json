        "Returns the status of a graph run that is currently scheduled or is executing. A graph is currently\ndefined as a single scheduled task or a task graph composed of a scheduled root task and one or more child\ntasks. For the purposes of this function, root task refers to either the single\nscheduled task or the root task in a task graph.",
        "This function returns details for graph runs that are currently executing or are next scheduled to run within the next 8 days. To retrieve\nthe details for graph runs that have completed in the past 60 minutes, query the COMPLETE_TASK_GRAPHS table function.",

        "Returns results only for the ACCOUNTADMIN role, the task owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the task) or a role with\nthe global MONITOR EXECUTION privilege. Note that unless a role with the MONITOR EXECUTION privilege also has the USAGE privilege on the\ndatabase and schema that store the task, the DATABASE_NAME and SCHEMA_NAME values in the output are NULL.",
        "When the CURRENT_TASK_GRAPHS function is queried, its task name and result limit arguments are applied first\nfollowed by the WHERE and LIMIT clause, respectively, if specified. In addition, the CURRENT_TASK_GRAPHS function returns records in\ndescending SCHEDULED_TIME order.",
