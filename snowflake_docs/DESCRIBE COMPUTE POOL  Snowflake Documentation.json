        "While Snowflake is provisioning a node, initially the value in the active_nodes and idle_nodes columns is 0, and the value in the target_nodes column is 1. (The value in the target_nodes column is the same as the value that you specified for the MIN_NODES parameter.) This indicates that there should be one node in the compute pool that Snowflake is provisioning.",
        "After Snowflake provisions one node, the value in the idle_nodes column is 1 (assuming that there are no services running). The value in the target_nodes column is still 1, indicating there should be one node in the compute pool.",

        "While Snowflake is provisioning a node, the value in the state column is resizing. To determine how many nodes Snowflake is adding, check the value in the target_nodes column.",
        "For example, suppose that the value in the, active_nodes column is 1, the value in the idle_nodes column is 0, and you resize the compute pool by updating the MIN_NODES property from 1 to 2. In this case, the value in the target_nodes column is 2 (the number of nodes that should be in the compute pool). From this, you can infer that Snowflake is provisioning one additional node.",
