    "paragraphs": [
        "As part of Snowflake\u2019s continued commitment to providing best-in-class Transport Layer Security (TLS) we are\nmigrating all endpoints used by connectors, drivers, or SQL API clients to a new\nload balancing stack based on the open source Envoy Proxy,\nas described in Snowflake\u2019s migration to Envoy for traffic management.",
        "While this migration is expected be transparent for most customers, there are two changes which may require action,\ndepending on client-specific configuration:",
        "Change of TLS server-side implementation.",
        "Enabling of TLS 1.3 and deprecation of weak TLS 1.2 cipher suites.",
        "Details follow:",
        "When a region is switched over to terminating TLS using Envoy, some Snowflake Java-based clients\nwith custom Security Provider configurations may experience issues establishing TLS connections.\nConfiguration of this kind is very uncommon. To reduce connectivity problems,\nJava clients should verify that a security provider that supports Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), such as SunEC or BouncyCastleProvider,\nis enabled in their java.security file. SunEC is enabled by default.",
        "For more details on how to ensure your clients are configured for compatibility see Snowflake knowledge base article Envoy migration updates.",
        "Once a region is migrated to Envoy, TLS 1.3 is automatically available, and capable clients will begin negotiating connections using this most up-to-date version of TLS. TLS 1.2 will continue to be supported.",
        "Initially, to maintain backwards compatibility for as many customers as possible, the following TLS 1.2 cipher suites will continue to be supported in multi-tenant regions:",
        "Strong ciphersuites (preferred, and always used if supported by the client):",
        "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",
        "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
        "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
        "Weak ciphersuites (for backwards-compatibility, not available in US Gov regions)",
        "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
        "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
        "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA",
        "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA",
        "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256",
        "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA",
        "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA",
        "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256",
        "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256",
        "Approximately one month after TLS 1.3 is enabled:",
        "For accounts observed to be connecting exclusively via TLS 1.3 or the preferred TLS 1.2 cipher suites above\nduring this period, and for all newly created accounts, TLS 1.3 or TLS 1.2 with strong ciphersuites\nwill be made mandatory when connecting to Snowflake using public IP addresses. Weak TLS 1.2 cipher suites will no longer be an option.",
        "For accounts identified to be connecting with TLS 1.2 cipher suites on the weak list above,\ntargeted communications will be sent recommending a client-side upgrade to move to TLS 1.3 or\nstrong TLS 1.2 ciphers. These accounts will continue to be able to use legacy cipher suites\nfor up to 3 months following the targeted notification.",
        "After the 3 month notification period, a choice of strong TLS 1.2 cipher suites or TLS 1.3\nwill be mandatory for both Public IP and Private Link / Private Service Connect access.",
        "No action is required at this time, but this information is being provided now so\nthat clients may proactively upgrade their TLS client implementations ahead of the\ntargeted communication requiring an upgrade.",
        "TLS 1.3 offers multiple improvements, including faster TLS handshakes and simpler, more secure cipher suites.\nThese changes provide better performance and stronger security.\nUpgrading to a TLS 1.3 compatible client is highly recommended.",
        "When will these changes be occurring?",
        "The change in TLS server implementation has been rolling out gradually across all clouds and regions from July 2024 and is ongoing.",
        "Affected customers will receive targeted notifications ahead of weak TLS ciphersuites being disabled for their account/region, which will be complete globally no later than March 1 2025.",
        "Ref: 1727",
        "Was this page helpful?"
