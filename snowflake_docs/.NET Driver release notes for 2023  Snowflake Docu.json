        "This article contains the release notes for the .NET Driver, including the following when applicable:",
        "Behavior changes",

        "Customer-facing bug fixes",
        "Snowflake uses semantic versioning for .NET Driver updates.",
        "See .NET Driver for documentation.",
        "None",
        "Fixed an issue with enabling certificate revocation checks.",
        "Added documentation on how to enable Arrow format.",
        "Implemented the validation of the account name format in connection parameters.",
        "Added synchronization of accessing query context cache.",
        "Added support for managing the frequency of retries for unsuccessful connection requests:",
        "Added the RETRY_TIMEOUT parameter with a default value of 300 seconds.",
        "Updated how the driver uses the CONNECTION_TIMEOUT and maxHttpRetries connection parameters and changed the default value  of CONNECTION_TIMEOUT to 300 seconds.",
        "Arrow format is now available as a preview feature (will be enabled by default in the future)",
        "Fixed an issue relating to failures with unexpected exceptions with HTAP metadata optimization.",
        "Fixed an issue with HTAP that could occur when changing databases or schemas.",
        "Implemented asynchronous cleanup while destroying a pool to avoid potential deadlocks.",
        "Removed confusing error information for PUT commands for GCP.",
        "Fixed incorrect SnowflakeDbConnection.Dispose behavior.",
        "Added support for hybrid transactional and analytical processing:",
        "Added retry context in retries for query requests.",
        "Added query context caching.",
        "Added the GetQueryId() method to SnowflakeDbCommand to retrieve the query ID of the most\nrecent executed query to match the existing functionality in SnowflakeDbDataReader.",
        "Fixed an issue where PUT/GET commands could fail with internal stages on Azure government cloud accounts.",
        "Decreased memory usage in PUT/GET operations.",
        "Fixed an issue that could occur while uploading and downloading data when source files differed from destination files,\nsuch as might occur due to automatic file compression.",
        "None.",
        "Fixed an issue where test connections were\u00a0not reused when created successfully.",
        "Fixed an issue where the * and ? wildcards did not work correctly in file paths.",
        "Fixed an issue where the driver incorrectly required a username and password for external browser authentication.",
        "Fixed an issue where, under certain conditions, the .NET driver could retry HTTP requests indefinitely.\nPreviously, during an outage the .NET driver would retry the failed HTTP call continuously until the request\nsucceeds or until someone force kills the operation.",
        "With this change, disables infinite HTTP retries originating from execute and executeQuery calls. Now, the .NET driver\nlimits HTTP retries to seven, by default. Customers can set the MAXHTTPRETRIES connection parameter to\ncustomize the maximum number of retries. Customers can set MAXHTTPRETRIES=0 to remove the retry limit,\nbut doing so runs the risk of the .NET driver infinitely retrying failed HTTP calls.",
        "Improved handling of remote paths containing a subdirectory in a GET command.",
        "Fixed an issue with connection pools that could occur when a dirty connection is closed and the\nBeginTransaction method is called explicitly.",

        "Fixed an intermittent \u201cAuthentication token has expired\u201d or \u201cSession no longer exists\u201d issue when connection pooling\nenabled.",
        "Removed use of WinHttpHandler.",
        "Fixed an issue where retries on chunk downloading would occasionally fail, such as when a network error occurred\nafter the data was partially downloaded.",

        "Fixed an issue where query execution would intermittently fail after a timeout occurred.",
        "Fixed an issue where the .NET driver would fail to execute PUT commands in an FIPS-enabled deployment.",
