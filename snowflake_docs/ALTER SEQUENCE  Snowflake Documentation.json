    "paragraphs": [
        "Modifies the properties for an existing sequence.",
        "CREATE SEQUENCE , DROP SEQUENCE , SHOW SEQUENCES , DESCRIBE SEQUENCE",
        "Specifies the identifier for the sequence to alter. If the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire string must be enclosed in\ndouble quotes. Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "For more details about identifiers, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Specifies the new identifier for the sequence; must be unique for the schema.",
        "For more details about identifiers, see Identifier requirements.",
        "You can move the object to a different database and/or schema while optionally renaming the object. To do so, specify\na qualified new_name value that includes the new database and/or schema name in the form\ndb_name.schema_name.object_name or schema_name.object_name, respectively.",
        "Note",
        "The destination database and/or schema must already exist. In addition, an object with the same name cannot already\nexist in the new location; otherwise, the statement returns an error.",
        "Moving an object to a managed access schema is prohibited unless the object owner (that is, the role that has\nthe OWNERSHIP privilege on the object) also owns the target schema.",
        "When an object is renamed, other objects that reference it must be updated with the new name.",
        "Specifies the properties to set for the sequence:",
        "Specifies the step interval of the sequence:",
        "For positive sequence interval n, the next n-1 values are reserved by each sequence call.",
        "For negative sequence interval -n, the next n-1 lower values are reserved by each sequence call.",
        "Supported values are any non-zero value that can be represented by a 64-bit two\u2019s complement integer.",
        "Specifies whether or not the values are generated for the sequence in\nincreasing order.",
        "ORDER specifies that the values generated for a sequence or auto-incremented column are in increasing order (or, if the interval\nis a negative value, in decreasing order).",
        "For example, if a sequence or auto-incremented column has START 1 INCREMENT 2, the generated values might be\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.",
        "NOORDER specifies that the values are not guaranteed to be in increasing order.",
        "For example, if a sequence has START 1 INCREMENT 2, the generated values might be 1, 3, 101, 5, 103, etc.",
        "NOORDER can improve performance when multiple INSERT operations are performed concurrently (for example, when multiple\nclients are executing multiple INSERT statements).",
        "Note",
        "If a sequence is set to NOORDER, you cannot change the sequence to ORDER.",
        "Adds a comment or overwrites an existing comment for the sequence.",
        "Specifies the properties to unset for the sequence, which resets them to the defaults.",
        "Currently, the only property you can unset is COMMENT, which removes the comment, if one exists, for the sequence.",
        "The first/initial value for a sequence cannot be changed after the sequence is created.",
        "Regarding metadata:",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
        "Rename sequence myseq to newseq:",
        "More examples are available in Using Sequences.",
