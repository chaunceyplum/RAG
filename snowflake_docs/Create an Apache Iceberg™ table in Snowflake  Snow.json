        "To create an Iceberg table that works with Snowflake Open Catalog, see Use Apache Iceberg\u2122 tables with Snowflake Open Catalog in Snowflake.",
        "To create an Iceberg table with Snowflake as the catalog,\nyou must specify an external volume and a base location (directory on the external volume)\nwhere Snowflake can write table data and metadata.\nFor instructions on creating an external volume, see Configure an external volume.",

        "For more information, see Manage Apache Iceberg\u2122 tables.",
        "To create an Iceberg table that uses an external catalog, or no catalog at all, you must specify an\nexternal volume and a catalog integration.\nIf you use an external Iceberg catalog, you might also need to specify additional parameters. For example, when you use AWS Glue as the catalog,\nyou must specify a catalog table name.",
        "When you create an Iceberg table that uses an external catalog, Snowflake performs an initial metadata refresh.\nYou can also manually refresh the table metadata using the ALTER ICEBERG TABLE \u2026 REFRESH command to\nsynchronize the metadata with the most recent table changes. For more information, see Refresh the table metadata.",
        "Note",
        "The CREATE ICEBERG TABLE command supports different options for different external catalogs. The examples in this section specify only\nsome of the available options. To view the full syntax, see the following pages:",
