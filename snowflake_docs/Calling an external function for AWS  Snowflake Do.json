        "This topic describes how to call an external function.",
        "An external function is called like any other UDF (user-defined function). (And, like any\nother UDF, an external function is called the same way regardless of platform.)",
        "If you have not already done so, make sure that your session is using the database and schema that contain the function.",
        "(External functions are database objects; when you call the function, the database and schema containing the function must be in\nuse in your session, or you must specify the fully-qualified name of the function.)",
        "If appropriate, and if you have not already done so, grant USAGE privilege on the external function to one or more Snowflake\nroles that need to call the external function.",
        "(A role must have USAGE or OWNERSHIP privileges on an external function to call it.)",
        "For example:",
        "Using an appropriate role, call your external function as part of an SQL statement. If you created one of the sample external\nfunctions supplied by Snowflake, you can call the function as shown below:",
        "If you used a function name other than echo, then replace echo with the actual function name.",
        "The returned value should be similar to:",

        "0 is the row number of the returned value.",
        "42, \"Adams\" is the returned value.",
