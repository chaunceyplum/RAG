        "The data type of the returned value is DOUBLE.",
        "If all records inside a group are NULL, this function returns NULL.",
        "For single-record inputs, STDDEV and STDDEV_SAMP both return NULL. This is different from the Oracle behavior, where STDDEV_SAMP returns NULL for a single record and STDDEV returns 0.",
        "When passed a VARCHAR expression, this function implicitly casts the input to floating point values. If the cast cannot be performed, an error is returned.",

        "The following example calculates the standard deviation for a small sample of integers:",
        "Note that the function STDDEV_SAMP returns the same result:",
        "The following example uses a small table named menu_items, which lists items for sale from a food\ntruck. If you would like to create and load this table, see Create and load the menu_items table.",
        "To find the sample standard deviation for both the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the sale price for the\nDessert rows, run this query:",
        "The following example also uses the menu_items table (see Create and load the menu_items table)\nbut calls the STDDEV function as a window function.",
        "The window function partitions rows by the menu_category column. Therefore, the standard deviation is\ncalculated once for each category, and that value is repeated in the result for each row in the group.\nIn this example, the rows must be grouped by both the menu category and the cost of goods sold.",
        "The following output is a partial result set for this query (the first 15 rows):",
        "To create and insert rows into the menu_items table that is used in some function examples,\nrun the following SQL commands. (This table contains 60 rows. It is based on, but not identical to,\nthe menu table in the\nTasty Bytes sample database.)",
