        "This behavior change is in the 2023_03 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "In a future release, the RETENTION_TIME column in the DATABASES view will change. In addition, a new RESOURCE_GROUP column will be added to the view.",
        "The data retention period for a database is determined by the retention time parameter settings set on the database and account. These parameters are DATA_RETENTION_TIME _IN_DAYS and MIN_DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS.",
        "If the retention time is not explicitly set for a database, it inherits the setting for the account.",
        "If there is no retention time set at the account level, the default retention time for a database is 1 day.",
        "The maximum retention time for a transient database is 1 day, regardless of the account-level setting.",
        "If there is a minimum retention time set for the account, and a retention time explicitly set on a database, the effective retention time for the database is the greater of the two: MAX(DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS, MIN_DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS).",
        "The RETENTION_TIME column in the Account Usage DATABASES View might display the incorrect value in the following scenarios:",
        "If there is no explicit retention time set for transient databases, and the retention time for the account is set to 7 days, the RETENTION_TIME column value is 7 days. This is incorrect. The maximum data retention time for a transient database is 1 day.",
        "If the minimum retention time for an account is 7 days, and the retention time setting for a database is 4 days, the RETENTION_TIME column value is 4 days. This is incorrect. The minimum account retention time is longer and therefore overrides the retention time explicitly set for the database.",
        "If the retention time is set to 10 days for a database, then unset, the RETENTION_TIME column value is the unset value (in this case 10). This might be incorrect.",
        "The RETENTION_TIME column value  behaves as follows:",
        "In some cases, the RETENTION_TIME column displays an incorrect data retention time for databases.",
        "The RETENTION_TIME column will display the correct data retention time for databases.",
        "For more information about setting the data retention period, refer to Specifying the Data Retention Period for an Object.",
        "In a future release, the Account Usage DATABASES view will include the following new column:",

        "Data Type",
        "Description",
        "RESOURCE_GROUP",
