        "With Universal Search, you can quickly and easily find objects in your account, data products available to you in the Snowflake Marketplace,\nrelevant Snowflake Documentation topics, and relevant Snowflake Community Knowledge Base articles all from the Snowsight home page.",
        "Universal Search understands your query and information about your database objects and can find objects with names that differ from\nyour search terms. Even if you misspell or type only part of your search term, you can still see useful results.",
        "When you use Universal Search, you can use natural language to describe what you\u2019re looking for. For example, you can use keyword search\nterms, like \u201copportunities\u201d or \u201csales opportunities\u201d, or use more conversational natural language search terms, like\n\u201csales opportunities that are likely to close\u201d or \u201cwhich opportunities came from partner referrals\u201d.",
        "For example, if you search for \u201czip codes\u201d, Universal Search returns results such as listings on the Snowflake Marketplace that mention postal\ncode data and a table with the column name postal_code.",
        "To make it easier to find the right data for your project, object metadata such as names, comments, and tags for objects and columns\nare searched. Universal Search searches only the object metadata, not the contents of your database objects.",

        "If you\u2019re not on the home page, select Search and then enter search terms.",
        "Press the return or enter key to execute the search.",
        "Results are displayed in categories. If a category isn\u2019t displayed, there are no results for that category or your currently active role\ndoesn\u2019t have access to those results.",
        "Select a search result to view details. For a database object, you can select Open in Worksheets to query the object in a worksheet.",
        "To get or purchase listings offered on the Snowflake Marketplace that appear in the results, you must have agreed to the Snowflake Provider\nand Consumer Terms. See\nLegal requirements for providers and consumers of listings.",
