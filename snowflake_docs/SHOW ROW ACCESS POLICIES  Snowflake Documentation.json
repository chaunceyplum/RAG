        "Row access policy DDL",
        "Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL\nwildcard characters (% and _).",
        "For example, the following patterns return the same results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",
        "The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "The string does not have to include the full object name; partial names are supported.",
        "Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output)",
        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'B' LIMIT ... FROM 'A' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'AB' would return results (if any rows match the input strings).",
        "Optionally specifies the scope of the command. Specify one of the following:",
        "Returns records for the entire account.",
        "Returns records for the current database in use or for a specified database (db_name).",
        "If you specify DATABASE without db_name and no database is in use, the keyword has no effect on the output.",
        "Returns records for the current schema in use or a specified schema (schema_name).",
        "SCHEMA is optional if a database is in use or if you specify the fully qualified schema_name (for example, db.schema).",
        "If no database is in use, specifying SCHEMA has no effect on the output.",
        "Returns records for the named Snowflake Native App or application package.",
        "Default: Depends on whether the session currently has a database in use:",
        "Database: DATABASE is the default (that is, the command returns the objects you have privileges to view in the database).",
        "No database: ACCOUNT is the default (that is, the command returns the objects you have privileges to view in your account).",

        "Row access policy",
        "OWNERSHIP is a special privilege on an object that is automatically granted to the role that created the object, but can also be transferred using the GRANT OWNERSHIP command to a different role by the owning role (or any role with the MANAGE GRANTS privilege).",
        "The USAGE privilege on the parent database and schema are required to perform operations on any object in a schema.",
        "For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see Creating custom roles.",

        "The command does not require a running warehouse to execute.",
        "The value for LIMIT rows cannot exceed 10000. If LIMIT rows is omitted, the command results in an error if the result set is larger than 10K rows.",
        "To view results for which more than 10K records exist, either include LIMIT rows or query the corresponding view in the Snowflake Information Schema.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",
        "The following example is representative of a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role executing the query.",
        "The following example is representative of a role that does not have USAGE on the parent schema in which row access policies exist and is\nnot the ACCOUNTADMIN role.",
