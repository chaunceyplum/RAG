        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the preview of additional CREATE OR ALTER commands. These\ncommands combine the functionality of the CREATE command and the ALTER command. A CREATE OR ALTER statement\nexecutes as a CREATE statement if the object doesn\u2019t exist. If it does exist, it transforms the object\naccording to the object definition in the statement.",
