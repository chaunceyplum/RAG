        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "Not available in government regions.",
        "This topic describes how to register data so it can be linked into a Snowflake Data Clean Room.",
        "The types of objects that can be linked into a clean room differs depending on whether it is created in the web app or using the developer\nAPIs. Specific objects of these types must be registered before they can be linked.",
        "The web app of Snowflake Data Clean Rooms supports the following objects:",
        "Tables",
        "External tables",
        "Apache Iceberg\u2122 tables",
        "Dynamic tables",
        "Views",
        "Materialized views",
        "Secure views. The owner of a secure view must be the SAMOOHA_APP_ROLE role.",
        "Because Snowflake Data Clean Rooms rely on the Snowflake Native App Framework, you can link any object that is supported by the\nSnowflake Native App Framework.",
        "Note",
        "External tables and Iceberg tables must be explicitly allowed to be linked in a clean room. For more information, see Snowflake Data Clean Rooms: External and Iceberg tables.",
        "Before users can link data into a Snowflake Data Clean Room, the data must be registered at the  database, schema, or object level. If you\nregister a database or schema, all of the objects in that database or schema are registered.",
        "You can register databases, schemas, and objects using Snowsight or the\ndeveloper APIs. Using Snowsight is simpler, but requires that you have the ACCOUNTADMIN role.\nWith the developer APIs, the owner of an object can register it even if they are not an account administrator.",
        "Registering a database, schema, or object grants access to the SAMOOHA_APP_ROLE role, which is the role that developers use when they\nexecute the developer APIs.",
        "Note",
        "Registering a database or schema does not automatically register objects that are added after the registration. You must either register\nthe new object individually or use the web app\u2019s Snowflake Admin option to return to the Database Registration section, and then\nselect Resync.",
        "To register a database, schema, or object in Snowsight, do the following:",
        "Sign in to the web app.",
        "Select Admin \u00bb Snowflake Admin.",
        "Select Login to Snowflake, and authenticate as a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role.",
        "In the Database Registration section, select Edit, and then select the database, schema, or object.",
        "Select Save.",
        "The developer APIs let account administrators register databases, schemas, and objects programmatically. The owner of the database, schema,\nor object can register it.",
        "The following APIs are available:",
        "Task",
        "API",
        "Input",

        "For example, the owner of a schema MY_SCHEMA can register it by executing the following commands in a worksheet:",
