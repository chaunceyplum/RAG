        "Snowflake supports creating a single masking policy to differentiate the role in use for the session that executes a query\n(i.e. CURRENT_ROLE) and the object owner executing a query\n(e.g. view owner, INVOKER_ROLE). Uses cases of this type are typically more complicated than simply\ndetermining a set of values to mask and a relatively small audience (e.g. users with the analyst custom role) that can see unmasked\nvalues.",
        "Hashing and cryptographic/checksum can be used in masking policies to mask sensitive data.",
        "Before implementing any of these functions in a masking policy, it is important to consider\nwhether your use case with these functions involve JOIN operations. Under certain masking policy\nimplementations, creative JOIN operations that involve tables and views can lead to reverse engineering the masked value to its true value\nbased upon the following limitation:",
        "It is possible that collisions may occur because there may not be a 1:1 representation of the actual value (i.e. input) and the hashed,\ncryptographic, or checksum value based on the total number of values (i.e. output, the range of values) to transform.",
        "A 1:1 representation is more likely to occur until the total number of input values reaches the square root of the output values to\ntransform.",
        "For example, if the output values to hash is 144, then it is reasonable to expect that the first 12 values\n(i.e. 144^(1/2) \u2013 the square root of 144) will be unique and that collisions might occur for the remaining 132 values. Since this\nlimitation and its consequence is possible, it is advisable to never use hashed, cryptographic, or checksum functions in masking policies\nwhose values may be used in JOIN operations.",
        "Tip",
        "If the masking policy use case prioritizes collision avoidance for enhanced security, implement\nExternal Tokenization. Tokenization does not result in collisions because there is\nalways a 1:1 representation of the input and output values.",
        "If tokenization is not possible, one possible workaround is to implement a masking policy to differentiate between the session role\nexecuting a query (i.e. CURRENT_ROLE) and the object owner executing a query\n(i.e. INVOKER_ROLE).",
        "For example, the following masking policy assumes two different custom roles, CSR_EMPL_INFO and DBA_EMPL_INFO, to regulate access to\nemployee information.",
        "If the policy is applied to the table, then the policy will be inherited to any view created from the table. If the custom role\ndba_empl_info owns the view created from this table (i.e. has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the view), then only users with this custom\nrole can see the actual values if querying the view. Users with the csr_empl_info custom role always see a hashed value whether query\nis made on the table or view. All other users see NULL.",
