        "Preview Feature \u2014 Open",
        "Available to all accounts that are Enterprise Edition (or higher).",
        "To inquire about upgrading, please contact Snowflake Support.",
        "This preview introduces a new stored procedure, GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA, to generate synthetic data.",
        "Synthetic data is data that is generated programmatically to serve as a substitute for real data. You can use synthetic data to represent\ndata that is sensitive, confidential, or otherwise restricted. The synthetic data set has characteristics of the data set it represents,\nsuch as numbers of columns, column names, the data type of each column, and synthetically generated data values for each column. A data\nengineer can use synthetic data to test and validate workloads in Snowflake, particularly when the original data is sensitive and should\nnot be accessible to unauthorized users.",
        "In Snowflake, you can call the SNOWFLAKE.DATA_PRIVACY.GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA stored procedure to generate synthetic data from up to five\ninput tables. You specify an output table to store the synthetic data. Snowflake automatically creates and grants access to the output\ntable to the role that calls the stored procedure. If you need to generate the output table again, you can overwrite the existing output\ntable by modifying the stored procedure parameters.",
        "A data set that represents the statistical properties of the original data set helps data engineers to understand the statistical\nproperties of the real data set. Subsequently, the data engineer can test and validate solutions that are based on the real data set.",
        "A synthetic data set that is similar to a production data set enables production engineers to test and validate their production\nenvironment. The result is a more robust production environment.",
        "When you call the GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA stored procedure, you can optionally set the 'privacy_filter': True configuration option\nto apply a privacy filter to the output table. The privacy filter removes rows from the output table if the rows are too similar to the\ninput data set. The privacy threshold uses the nearest neighbor distance ratio (NNDR) and distance to closest record (DCR) values to\ndetermine whether a row should be removed from the output table.",
        "Snowflake uses an algorithm to generate synthetic data that is similar to the original data set. The algorithm uses the original data set\nto generate synthetic data that has the same statistical properties as the original data set. The algorithm leverages copulas to capture\nthe distribution of data both within and across columns. Once this distribution is captured, the synthetic data resembles the original data\nstatistically but does not have a direct reference or link to any row from the original data.",
        "If you have multiple input tables, you can specify join keys, which are columns in the input table. The algorithm collects the\nspecified join keys across the input tables, converts them to integers, casts them back to their original format, and reattaches them to\nthe synthesized tables.",
        "To generate synthetic data, each input table that you specify must meet the following requirements:",
        "Tables and views.",
        "A minimum of 20 distinct rows.",
        "The columns in the input table can have the following data types. Columns with an unsupported data type return null for all values in\nthe column:",
        "All numeric types (NUMBER, DECIMAL, FLOAT, INTEGER, and so on)",
        "BOOLEAN",
        "All date and time types (DATE, DATETIME, TIME, TIMESTAMP, and so on) except TIMESTAMP_TZ",
        "STRING, VARCHAR, CHAR, CHARACTER, TEXT",
        "If more than half of the values in a STRING column are unique values, Snowflake replaces the\nvalue with a redacted value in the output table due to privacy concerns.",
        "Additionally, make sure that your input table does not exceed these limits:",
        "5 total input tables.",
        "100 columns per input table.",
        "2.3M rows",
        "To generate synthetic data, you must use a role with each the following grants:",
        "USAGE on the warehouse that you want to use for queries.",
        "SELECT on the input table from which you want to generate synthetic data.",
        "USAGE on the database and schema that contain the input table, and on the database that contains the output table.",
        "CREATE TABLE on the schema that contains the output table.",
        "OWNERSHIP on the output tables. The simplest way to do this is by granting OWNERSHIP to the schema where the output table is\ngenerated. (However, if someone has applied a FUTURE GRANT on this schema, table ownership will be silently overridden \u2013 that is,\nGRANT OWNERSHIP ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA db.my_schema TO ROLE some_role will automatically grant OWNERSHIP to some_role on any\nnew tables created in schema my_schema.)",
        "All users can access the SNOWFLAKE.DATA_PRIVACY.GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA stored procedure. Access is made available using the\nSNOWFLAKE.CORE_VIEWER database role, which is granted to the PUBLIC role.",
        "You must accept the Anaconda terms and conditions in your Snowflake account in order to enable this\nfeature.",
        "Use a medium Snowpark-optimized warehouse. While GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA is running, do not run any other queries in that warehouse.",
        "Specify up to 5 input tables in a single call of the SNOWFLAKE.DATA_PRIVACY.GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA stored procedure.",
        "Choose proper input tables. For more information, see Requirements (in this topic).",
        "This example uses the Snowflake Sample Data database, which has been shared with nearly all Snowflake customers.",
        "Follow these steps to generate synthetic data from multiple input table:",
        "Configure the access control for the data_engineer role and allow them to create all of the necessary objects:",
        "Create views from the Snowflake Sample Data database:",
        "Query the input tables to view the data and confirm each table has 5000 rows:",
        "Call the GENERATE_SYNTHETIC_DATA stored procedure to generate the synthetic data and store it in an output table:",
        "Query the output table to view the synthetic data:",
