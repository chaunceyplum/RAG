        "Note that each internal stage stores not only files to be loaded into tables, but also \u201cstate\u201d information that is used to ensure delivery\nof rows from Kafka to the table.",
        "If a stage and its state information are preserved, then if the connector is stopped and restarted, the connector automatically tries to\nresume at the point where it left off. However, if a stage is removed, the connector cannot resume where it left off.",

        "If you did not map Kafka topics to tables using the snowflake.topic2table.map parameter in the Kafka configuration properties, the Kafka connector created new tables using the topic names. The table name is in uppercase but is otherwise identical to the topic name, as long as the topic name does not violate Snowflake object naming rules. For example, Snowflake creates a table name TEMPERATURE_DATA for a Kafka topic named temperature_data.",
