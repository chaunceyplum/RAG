        "a simple(r) scenario for this error is when there is an idle timeout configured on a proxy or security appliance between the client driver and Snowflake, which when expires, terminates the connection without notifying the parties",
        "oftentimes, troubleshooting the true underlying root cause of what exactly, and why is tearing down the connections between the client driver and Snowflake can be a complex endeavor where details are out of scope for this documentation",
        "Resolution scenario:",
        "You can configure a TTL inside the JDBC driver which will gracefully close the connections from the client side sooner than they would be torn down by a remote idle timeout; preventing the issue. Setting is available from JDBC driver version 3.12.17; and from 3.13.30 there\u2019s a default (1 minute) already configured.",

The connection is not successful, because the certificate seen by the client driver is not a match for the hostname in the request.",
        "Most likely causes include:",

        "Resolution scenario:",
        "For the first cause, please either use the regionless notation in the account field of the configuration, such as myorg-test, myorg-prod, etc. Alternatively, if you want to use the locator notation, make sure to use the correct one as indicated in the Configuring a client, driver, library, or third-party application to connect to Snowflake documentation. For example, an account in AWS EU Frankfurt would be xy12345.eu-central-1.",

        "If the issue is intermittent and specifically; if NoHttpResponseException happens very quickly (milliseconds) after the request has been sent, this error indicates that the TCP session between the client driver and the server is down, just the driver did not know about it. This latter often happens if an intermediary proxy/load balancer tears down the session between the client and the server,  without letting any of the parties know.",
        "Resolution scenario:",
        "For persistent errors and where the NoHttpResponseException happens after a longer wait following the request, please follow the Troubleshooting steps.",
        "For occasions where this exception is intermittent and is thrown very quickly after the client driver sends the request, between versions 3.12.17 and 3.13.30 you have a configuration option net.snowflake.jdbc.ttl to ensure idle connections are closed and thus prevent the intermediary node (such as loadbalancer) tearing it down unexpectedly, without telling the clients on the other ends. For more information, see I/O error: Connection reset.",
        "From JDBC driver version 3.13.30 and onwards; you still have this configuration option but usually it\u2019s not necessary to change it, as it now has a default value of 1 minute idle timeout (60 seconds).",
