        "The following new features, behavior changes, and updates (enhancements, fixes, etc.) have been introduced this month. If you have any\nquestions about these additions, please contact\nSnowflake Support.",
        "Important",
        "Each release may include updates that require the web interface to be refreshed.",
        "As a general practice, to ensure these updates do not impact your usage, we recommend refreshing the web interface after each Snowflake\nrelease has been deployed.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the general availability of support for Java UDTFs (user-defined tabular functions) on\nAmazon Web Services (AWS).",
        "Java UDTFs extend Snowflake\u2019s native development capabilities by combining the advantages of table functions with the power, flexibility,\nand ease of programming in Java.",
        "For more information, see Tabular Java UDFs (UDTFs).",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the preview of data classification for all accounts using Snowflake Enterprise Edition\n(or higher).",
        "Classification enables categorizing potentially personal and/or sensitive data stored in Snowflake tables and views, which can then be used\nto enable a variety of data governance, sharing, and privacy use cases, including:",
        "Classification of PII (Personally Identifiable Information) data.",
        "Policy management for setting and controlling access to private data.",
        "Anonymization of personal data.",
        "For more information, see Sensitive data classification.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce preview support for object dependencies. An object dependency means that in order to\noperate on an object, the object that is being operated on must reference metadata for itself or reference metadata for at least one other\nobject.",
        "Snowflake tracks object dependencies in the Account Usage view\nOBJECT_DEPENDENCIES. To discover object dependencies, query the\nOBJECT_DEPENDENCIES view.",
        "For more information, see Object Dependencies.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce support for Snowpark stored procedures, which allows you to write stored procedures in Scala\nusing the Snowpark API.",
        "In your stored procedure, you can use the Snowpark API for Scala to host your data pipelines in Snowflake. For example, you can write\nstored procedures in cases where you need to execute your Snowpark code without running a client application (e.g. from a task).",
        "We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of the following new region:",
        "Cloud Platform",
        "Region",
        "Microsoft Azure",
        "UAE North (Dubai)",
        "With the addition of this region, Snowflake now supports thirty global regions across three cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, and Azure), including\nthree regions that support compliance with US government regulations.",
        "The new region supports all Snowflake editions. You can provision initial accounts in the region\nthrough self-service or a Snowflake representative.",
        "The following view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema is now available with this release:",
        "View",
        "Description",
        "OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES",
        "This ACCOUNT_USAGE view displays one row for each object dependency.",
        "For example, while creating a view from a single table, the view is dependent on the table. Snowflake returns one row to record the\ndependency of the view on the table.",
        "For more information, see Object Dependencies \u2014 Preview (in this topic).",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of Snowpipe data loads triggered by Google Cloud Storage (GCS) event\nnotifications delivered using Google Cloud Pub/Sub (i.e. \u201cauto-ingest Snowpipe for GCS\u201d).",
        "Note that auto-ingest Snowpipe for Amazon S3 or Microsoft Azure blob storage is already generally available.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the preview of the ability to manually execute a single run of a scheduled task (i.e. a\nstandalone task or root task in a task tree). Executing a run of a root task triggers a cascading run of child tasks in the tree, as though\nthe root task had run on its defined schedule. Previously, a scheduled task could only start when its next scheduled run occurred.",
        "This feature is implemented through a new SQL command, EXECUTE TASK, which can be executed by the task owner\n(i.e. the role that has the OWNERSHIP privilege on the tasks) or any role that has the OPERATE privilege on the tasks. The SQL command\ntriggers asynchronous runs of a task.",
        "The EXECUTE TASK command is useful for testing new or modified standalone tasks before you allow them into a production schedule. Call this\nSQL command in scripts or stored procedures, or execute the command using third-party tools or services to integrate tasks in external data\npipelines.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce preview support for Delta Lake in external tables. Delta Lake is a\ntable format on your data lake that supports ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions among other features. All\ndata in Delta Lake is stored in Apache Parquet format.",
        "Query the Parquet files in a Delta Lake by creating external tables that reference your cloud storage locations enhanced with Delta Lake.",
        "Preview features are intended for evaluation and testing purposes, and are not recommended for use in production.",
        "In the 6.2 behavior change release, the\nSHOW SHARES Command & Data Sharing UI: Changes to Output\nbehavior change was enabled by default with the 2021_10 bundle. The behavior change is now disabled and has been removed from the\nbundle.",
        "The behavior change will be available in the 2022_02 bundle.",
        "With this release, the endpoints for the SQL API now include the version of the API. The updated endpoints are:",
        "/api/v2/statements/",
        "/api/v2/statements/statementHandle",
        "/api/v2/statements/statementHandle/cancel",
        "When sending a request to these new endpoints, you do not need to set the format field to jsonv2 in the resultSetMetaData\nfield. If the format field is set in the request, the SQL API ignores the field.",
        "The older, deprecated version of the SQL API does not support changes to the endpoints or the format field. When using this version of\nthe SQL API, you must use the original endpoints and supply the format field as part of the request.",
        "With this release, the SQL API removes limitations on fetching results concurrently (i.e. in parallel with multiple threads). The SQL API\nsupports requests from multiple threads.",
        "This change is not applicable to the older, deprecated version of the SQL API.",
        "Was this page helpful?",
