        "Snowflake is provided as a self-managed service that runs completely on cloud infrastructure. This means that all three layers of\nSnowflake\u2019s architecture (storage, compute, and cloud services) are deployed and managed entirely\non a selected cloud platform.",
        "A Snowflake account can be hosted on any of the following cloud platforms:",
        "Amazon Web Services (AWS)",

        "On each platform, Snowflake provides one or more regions where the account is provisioned.",
        "If your organization\u2019s other cloud services are already hosted on one of these platforms, you can choose to host all your Snowflake\naccounts on the same platform. However, you can also choose to host your accounts on a different platform.",
        "Note",
        "The cloud platform you choose for each Snowflake account is completely independent from your other Snowflake accounts. In fact, you can choose to\nhost each Snowflake account on a different platform, although this may have some impact on data transfer billing when loading data.",
        "Differences in unit costs for credits and data storage are calculated by region on each cloud platform.\nFor more information about pricing as it pertains to a specific region and platform, see the pricing page\n(on the Snowflake website).",

        "Some data transfer billing charges may apply when loading data from files staged across different platforms. For more information, see\nUnderstanding data transfer cost.",
