    "paragraphs": [
        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "This topic describes the criteria for publishing a Snowflake Native App to the Snowflake Marketplace.",
        "When your application package is ready to be published on the Snowflake Marketplace, you must submit it\nto Snowflake for approval.",
        "Note",
        "The approval process required to publish an app on the Snowflake Marketplace is in addition to the\nautomated security scan that is run when\nthe DISTRIBUTION property of an application package is set to EXTERNAL.",
        "Before creating a listing, verify that you understand the\nenforced requirements and ensure that your\napplication package follows each requirement. If an application package does not follow these requirements,\nyour submission may be rejected.",
        "If you receive a rejection notification for the application package you submitted, make the recommended\nchanges and resubmit your application package for approval.",
        "Snowflake provides a platform that allows providers to build, distribute, and monetize apps.",
        "The Snowflake review process ensures the quality of the apps that are published to the Snowflake\nMarketplace. To ensure a streamlined review process, Snowflake provides the following requirements and\nguidelines for apps that are published to the Snowflake Marketplace.",
        "All app functionality must be provided within the consumer account when the app is installed. For example, when\na consumer installs an app in their account all app functionality must be available without requiring that the consumer\ninstall additional components.",
        "Apps must deliver product experience on Snowflake and facilitate external requirements through Snowflake functionality.",
        "Apps should be based on data-centric use cases that leverage data stored in Snowflake.",
        "Apps must use Snowflake features to disclose the app\u2019s resource and access requirements and simplify the configuration process\nfor the consumer.",
        "Snowflake uses the following guidelines to determine if a Snowflake Native App meets the\nrequirements for publication on the Snowflake Marketplace. These requirements are verified when\nyou submit a listing with an attached application package to the Snowflake Marketplace.",
        "Immediate utility",
        "Apps must not be shell apps that advertise functionality.",
        "Apps must include a clear framework and instruction for utilizing app functionality.",
        "Apps should not crash, freeze, or otherwise function abnormally.",
        "Apps must list all required credentials and providers must share required credentials with\nSnowflake at submission for testing.",
        "Apps must be immediately actionable, allowing consumers to fully install and configure the app without\nneeding to contact the provider.",
        "Standalone",
        "Apps must not redirect consumers to an external service to enable application functionality.",
        "App interfaces must be accessible after installation directly from Snowflake.",
        "Apps cannot require consumers to create users or roles that provide access to an external service\nin the Snowflake consumer\u2019s account.",
        "Apps cannot use the Snowflake Marketplace as a distribution platform for cross-selling external\napplications or services.",
        "Data-centric",
        "Apps must leverage Snowflake data in one of the following ways:",
        "Share data from the app provider\u2019s account.",
        "Use datasets from the Snowflake Marketplace.",
        "Access data in the consumer account.",
        "Transparent",
        "All account-level privileges and references that the app requires must be listed in the\napplication package manifest file.",
        "All resource requirements for the Snowflake Native App must be listed in the\nmarketplace.yml\nfile of the app. The app must create these resources as part of installation and setup.",
        "All account-level privileges and references listed in the application package manifest file must be requested\nfrom the consumer through Snowsight or the Python Permission SDK.",
        "Apps must provide a readme file. Apps that do not include a Streamlit or custom user interface must include the\nfollowing information in the readme file:",
        "A description of what the app does.",
        "The steps the consumer must perform to configure the app after it is installed.",
        "The stored procedures and user-defined functions the app uses.",
        "The privileges the app requires.",
        "Example SQL commands that show consumers how to use the app.",
        "All required SQL commands must be delivered using Snowflake and formatted as code blocks.",
        "If the app provides sample data, you must include procedures on how to use the sample data.",
        "In addition to the requirements for submitting an application package to the Snowflake Marketplace,\nSnowflake also recommends the following best practices when publishing a Snowflake Native App:",
        "Ensure that all required files are uploaded to the named stage for the version of the app you are\nsubmitting, including:",
        "The manifest.yml file.",
        "The setup script.",
        "The readme.md file.",
        "Any external stored procedures or user-defined functions required by the application package.",
        "Any Streamlit files required by the application package.",
        "Any external source code, including Python, Java, etc.",
        "Ensure that the version of the app you are developing passes the\nautomated security scan.",
        "Test the new version of your application package by creating the application object locally by using the\nCREATE APPLICATION command.",
        "Do not add a new version to your application package or set the DISTRIBUTION property to EXTERNAL\nwhile you are developing and testing an app. These actions trigger the\nautomated security scan which\ndelays the development cycle.",
        "Instead, create the application object using\nfiles on a named stage.",
        "If your app includes a Streamlit app, test the application in Snowsight to ensure\nthe Streamlit app works as expected.",
        "Verify that interactions between the Streamlit app and Snowflake Worksheets are seamless\nand that the consumer does not have to navigate excessively between the two.",
        "Review all parts of a listing before submitting it for approval.",
        "Ensure that there are no typos or other textual errors in the listing, readme file, and\nStreamlit app.",
        "When an app trial listing expires, Snowflake automatically suspends the app to avoid consumers incurring\nextra compute costs to the consumer. Snowflake only suspends the objects owned by the app that are currently\nactive. Snowflake does not modify the status of objects that are already suspended.",
        "When a trial listing is converted to a full or paid listing, Snowflake attempts to re-enable the\napp by resuming tasks, containers, and compute pools. Snowflake only resumes services and compute pools\nthat have the auto_resume property set to false.",
        "Compute pools should be set to automatically suspend in combination with Snowpark Container Services\njobs to avoid idle compute nodes.",
        "For higher availability during upgrades and to reduce cold start latency, Snowflake recommends that you\nset the MIN_NODES parameter greater than 1.",
        "If connections across different services are required in the same app, use the DNS name of the service\ninstead of configuring an external access integration.",
        "Providers should configure an app to emit log messages and trace events that conform\nto supported event definitions\nto ensure that consumers understand what information is collected.",
        "Mandatory event definitions should be limited to the log messages and trace events required by the app. Excessive or unnecessary\nmandatory event definitions should be avoided.",
        "Adding new mandatory event definitions in a version upgrade must require the consumer re-enable event definitions\nfor the app.",
        "Use the Python Permission SDK to allow consumers to share optional events.",
