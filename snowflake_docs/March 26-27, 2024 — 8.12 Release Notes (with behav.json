        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of replication for stages, pipes, storage integrations, load history,\nand Snowpipe Streaming channels. You can replicate these objects to configure failover for data pipelines across\nregions and cloud platforms.",
        "As part of pipe object replication, pipes in a secondary database are in a READ_ONLY execution state and receive notifications, but\ndo not load data until you promote the secondary database to serve as the primary. After you promote a secondary database, the pipes will\ntransition to a FAILING_OVER execution state.",
        "With Snowpipe Streaming replication, the table object, table data, and the channel offsets associated with the table from the primary\ndatabase are replicated to the secondary database.",

        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of schema detection and evolution for Kafka connector with\nSnowpipe Streaming. The structure of tables in Snowflake can be defined and evolved automatically to support the structure of Kafka topic\nmessage data loaded by the Kafka connector using Snowpipe Streaming.",
        "For more information, see Schema detection and evolution for Kafka connector with Snowpipe Streaming.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce support for creating a memoizable function with constant arguments. This support\nprovides more flexibility in terms of how to define the function. Additionally, if you reference the function in a data access policy,\nsuch as a row access policy, you have more freedom in terms of how to define your policy. The function arguments can be any of the\nfollowing data types:",

        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the general availability to enable a data sharing provider to use the IS_DATABASE_ROLE_IN_SESSION\nfunction in the conditions of a masking policy or a row access policy to allow a data sharing consumer to access shared data that is protected\nby either of these policies. The function argument takes either the name of a database role or a column that contains database roles. This\nprovides more options to the provider to share data, allows the consumer to access sensitive data that the provider makes available, and\nremoves restrictions on policy-protected data when the consumer queries a shared table protected by a policy.",
        "IS_DATABASE_ROLE_IN_SESSION.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the general availability to track the chain of queries that call a stored procedure\nby using the parent_query_id and root_query_id columns. These columns allow you to see the query ID that performs a read\nor write operation on another object, and the query ID for the query that calls a stored procedure, respectively. The columns support\ncalling a stored procedure directly and nested stored procedure calls, such as when one stored procedure calls another stored procedure.",
        "This update was announced in preview during the 8.2 release. For details, see Example: Ancestor queries with stored procedures.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce the general availability to allow users in the data sharing consumer account to view\nshared tags and the tag references on shared objects when the tags and shared objects are in the same database. This update helps the\nconsumer to understand the data sensitivity of a shared object, such as a table containing PII data when the PII tag is set on a table\nand its columns.",
        "This update was announced in preview during the 7.33 release. For details, see Shared tag references.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of tracking objects modified by DDL operations in the Account Usage\nACCESS_HISTORY view. These operations include:",
