        "Not applicable.",
        "Fixed an issue with disrupted scheduling of ingestions during execution of dispatcher task.",

        "Not applicable.",
        "Fixed an issue where changing the ingestion schedule while the\ndispatcher task was running could lead to temporary duplication of the dispatcher task.",
        "The connector now requests permission to EXECUTE MANAGED TASK. This\nis in preparation for internal monitoring features that will help us\ndiscover and address issues earlier.",
        "Not applicable.",
        "Fixed an issue where changing the ingestion schedule while the\ndispatcher task was running could corrupt the internal state of the\nconnector so that it would not be able to schedule further ingestions.",
        "Versions released in between this and prior release notes had only internal\nchanges, and thus no release notes were published.",
        "Not applicable.",
        "A number of optimizations made to scheduling ingestions and ingesting itself.\nThis should result in slightly lower credit consumption, as well as increased\ningestion throughput, especially on tables with fewer than one million records.",
        "The connector now supports mixed-case and lowercase secret names.",
        "Ingestions should no longer fail due to issues with refreshing the access\ntoken. This may very rarely still occur for particularly large tables, but\nwill always be re-tried by the connector automatically.",
        "Added validation to prevent enabling the same Google Analytics property\ningestion from multiple Google Cloud Platform projects.",
        "Enabling multiple properties at once is now more resilient against issues with\nBigQuery connectivity. It will only fail the properties for which it\ncouldn\u2019t connect to BigQuery, and successfully enable all the others.",
        "Several stored procedures, meant specifically for early user interface, access were removed.\nThese stored procedures were generally not documented,\nand not part of our public API, but they may have been visible when listing\nprocedures exposed by the connector. There\u2019s no change in how the connector\nworks, or how it should be operated.",
        "The procedure CONFIGURE_CONNECTION now requires an additional parameter security_integration\nwith the name of the security integration created for\nthe connector. This applies only for worksheet-based setups. If you\u2019re setting\nthe connector up via the user interface, this change is transparent to you.",
        "Updated links to the connector\u2019s documentation.",
        "Improved reading tables available in BigQuery to ensure we only look at\nGoogle Analytics export tables, and filter out similarly-named tables. This\nissue could sometimes cause enabling new properties, or ingesting enabled\nproperties to fail.",
