        "You can log messages from a function or procedure handler written in JavaScript by using the snowflake object included with the\nSnowflake JavaScript API. When you\u2019ve set up an event table to store log entries, Snowflake stores log entries generated by your handler\ncode in the table. For reference about the JavaScript API, see JavaScript stored procedures API.",
        "Before logging from code, be sure you have the logging level set so that the messages you want are stored in the event table. For more\ninformation, see Setting levels for logging, metrics, and tracing.",
        "Note",
        "Before you can begin logging messages, you must set up an event table. For more information, see\nEvent table overview.",
        "You can access log messages by executing a SELECT command on the event table. For more information, see\nViewing log messages.",
        "For general information about setting up logging and retrieving messages in Snowflake, see\nLogging messages from functions and procedures.",
        "Code in the following example uses the included snowflake object to log messages at each of the supported levels.\nNote that a message logged from a method that processes an input row will be logged for every row processed by the UDF. If the UDF is\nexecuted in a large table, this can result in a large number of messages in the event table.",
        "When you create a log entry, you can add your own attributes in key-value pairs. Snowflake saves these custom attributes to the event\ntable\u2019s RECORD_ATTRIBUTES column.",
        "To add custom attributes when calling the snowflake.log method, assemble the key-value pairs in JSON that you pass as a third\nargument to the log function.",
        "Code in the following example logs a message \u201cLogging with attributes\u201d to the event table\u2019s VALUE column. It also adds two custom\nattributes to the RECORD_ATTRIBUTES column.",
        "Output of this log call appears in the event table as follows. Note that the RECORD_ATTRIBUTES column will include\nattributes that Snowflake adds automatically.",
