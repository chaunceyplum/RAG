        "Creates or replaces an Apache Iceberg\u2122 table in the current/specified schema\nusing Iceberg files in object storage (external cloud storage).\nThis type of Iceberg table requires a catalog integration.",
        "This topic refers to Iceberg tables as simply \u201ctables\u201d except where specifying Iceberg tables avoids confusion.",
        "Note",
        "Before creating a table, you must create the external volume where the Iceberg metadata\nand data files are stored.\nFor instructions, see Configure an external volume.",
        "You also need a catalog integration for the table.\nTo learn more, see Configure a catalog integration for files in object storage.",

        "Specifies the identifier (name) for the table; must be unique for the schema in which the table is created.",
        "In addition, the identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the\nentire identifier string is enclosed in double quotes (for example, \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also\ncase-sensitive.",
        "For more information, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Specifies the relative path of the Iceberg metadata file to use for column definitions.",
        "For example, if\ns3://mybucket_us_east_1/metadata/v1.metadata.json is the full path to your metadata file,\nand the external volume storage location is s3://mybucket_us_east_1/,\nspecify metadata/v1.metadata.json as the value for METADATA_FILE_PATH.",
        "Before Snowflake version 7.34, this parameter was called METADATA_FILE_NAME.",

        "Don\u2019t include a leading forward slash in the file path.",

        "The Parquet data files and Iceberg metadata files for the table must be within the BASE_LOCATION.",
        "To refresh the table, you must specify a path relative to the BASE_LOCATION. For example,\nif the full path to your metadata file is s3://mybucket_us_east_1/my_base_location/metadata/v1.metadata.json,\nspecify metadata/v1.metadata.json as the metadata-file-relative-path.",
        "For more information, see ALTER ICEBERG TABLE \u2026 REFRESH.",
        "Specifies the identifier (name) for the external volume where the Iceberg table stores its metadata files and data in Parquet\nformat. Iceberg metadata and manifest files store the table schema, partitions, snapshots, and other metadata.",
        "If you don\u2019t specify this parameter, the Iceberg table defaults to the external volume for the schema, database, or account.\nThe schema takes precedence over the database, and the database takes precedence over the account.",
        "Specifies the identifier (name) of the catalog integration for this table.",
        "If not specified, the Iceberg table defaults to the catalog integration for the schema, database, or account.\nThe schema takes precedence over the database, and the database takes precedence over the account.",
        "Specifies whether to replace invalid UTF-8 characters with the Unicode replacement character (\ufffd) in query results.\nYou can only set this parameter for tables that use an external Iceberg catalog.",
        "TRUE replaces invalid UTF-8 characters with the Unicode replacement character.",
