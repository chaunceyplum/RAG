        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "This topic describes how to set the release directive for an application package.",
        "Release directives determine the version of the app that is available to a consumer when they\ninstall or upgrade an app. Release directives are defined in the application package using the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command.",
        "There are two types of release directives:",
        "Allows a provider to specify the version of an application that specific\nSnowflake accounts can install. See\nadd a custom release directive for more information.",
        "Specifies the version and patch that is applicable to all consumers when\ninstalling a Snowflake Native App. If a provider creates versions V1 and V2 of an application, setting the\ndefault release directive to V2 ensures that when a consumer installs the Snowflake Native App, they install.",
        "See set a default release directive for\nmore information.",
        "If a provider creates version V2 and V3 of an application, they can assign V2 to be the default release and\ncreate a custom release directive to share V3 only with specific accounts. A provider may also\nshare version V3 of the application with a test account before publishing that version.",
        "Note",
        "If you specify both a default and custom release directive, the custom release directive always\ntakes precedence. In the example above, consumer accounts specified in the custom release directive\nwould only be able to install V3 of the application.",
        "You must define a release directive in an application package before you can perform the following tasks:",
        "Create a public listing with the application package as the data content.",
        "Install a Snowflake Native App in a consumer account.",
        "To set a release directive, a provider must have the MANAGE RELEASES privilege or ownership of the application\npackage.",
        "Use the ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command with SET DEFAULT RELEASE\nDIRECTIVE to set the default release directive as shown in the following\nexample:",
        "To update the default release directive for an application package, run the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command with SET DEFAULT RELEASE DIRECTIVE again, specifying\nnew values for VERSION or PATCH, as appropriate.",
        "To add a custom release directive, use the ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command with\nSET RELEASE DIRECTIVE. Use the ACCOUNTS clause to specify the accounts to which this\nrelease directive applies. For example:",
        "To update the version or patch for a custom release directive, use the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command with MODIFY RELEASE DIRECTIVE as shown\nin the following example:",
        "However, you cannot modify the accounts associated with the release directive. To change the\norganization and account associated with a release directive do the following:",
        "Remove the release directive from the application package by running the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command with UNSET RELEASE DIRECTIVE.",
        "Add the release directive back to the application package by running the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command with SET RELEASE DIRECTIVE and\nusing the ACCOUNTS clause to specify the list of accounts.",
        "Note",
        "When you change the organization and account associated with the release directive, add\nthe new release directive immediately after you remove the old one. If you don\u2019t, the installed\napps for the accounts assigned to the custom release directive revert to default release directive.",
        "To remove a custom release directive from an application package, use the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command with UNSET RELEASE DIRECTIVE as shown in the following\nexample:",
        "When installing an app from an application package in development mode, the version and\npatch are explicitly specified. However, when the application is installed using the following\ncommand:",
        "The release directive determines the version that is installed when running this command.",
        "To view the release directives by using SQL, run the\nSHOW RELEASE DIRECTIVES command as shown in the following example:",
