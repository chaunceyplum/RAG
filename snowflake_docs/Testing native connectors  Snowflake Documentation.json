        "application tests",
        "These unit tests are not different from unit tests for any other application. Parts of the system are mocked up to easily manipulate their returned values.\nThe connectors-native-sdk-test library, which as a library bundled with the SDK provides useful InMemory mockups of some classes responsible for communication with Snowflake.\nIt enables the developer to write and run unit tests on the local environment without a need to use any Snowflake connection.",
        "Integration tests require a connection to Snowflake and run queries against Snowflake objects. However, the used database objects are stand-alone in these kinds of tests.\nKeep in mind some Snowflake features may be unavailable in the context of Native Apps.",
        "Application tests are tests that run on a native app deployed into Snowflake.\nThese kinds of tests are quite time-consuming and might be costly, so the recommendation is to test only some main scenarios this way.",
        "Overall, the recommendation is to test as many cases as possible using unit tests and minimize the number of integration and application tests to the most critical paths.",
        "As mentioned above the Native SDK has a connectors-native-sdk-test library, which provides various features useful in tests. The main features are:",

        "in-memory implementations",
        "test builders",
        "Assertions provided in the library are based on the AssertJ fluent assertions.\nAll the assertions provided have a fabrication method implemented inside the NativeSdkAssertions class, furthermore,\nthis class inherits all of the original AssertJ fabrication methods, so only one import is needed to use both custom and base assertions.",
