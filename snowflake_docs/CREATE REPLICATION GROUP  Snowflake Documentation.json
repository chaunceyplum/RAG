However, no such agreement is in place for one or more of the accounts approved\nfor replication, regardless if they are Business Critical (or higher) accounts.",

        "Indicates the nth instance of a given unit of time. Each quanta of time is computed independently. For example, if 4/3 is\nspecified in the month field, then the refresh is scheduled for April, July and October (i.e. every 3 months, starting with the 4th\nmonth of the year). The same schedule is maintained in subsequent years. That is, the refresh is not scheduled to run in\nJanuary (3 months after the October run).",
        "Note",

        "When both a specific day of month and day of week are included in the cron expression, then the refresh is scheduled on days\nsatisfying either the day of month or day of week. For example, SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 0 10-20 * TUE,THU UTC'\nschedules a refresh at 0AM on any 10th to 20th day of the month and also on any Tuesday or Thursday outside of those dates.",

        "When a different interval is set (using ALTER <object> \u2026 SET REPLICATION_SCHEDULE)",
        "The base interval time starts the interval counter from the current clock time. For example, if an INTERVAL value of 10 is set and\nthe scheduled refresh is enabled at 9:03 AM, then the refresh runs at 9:13 AM, 9:23 AM, and so on. Note that we make a best effort to\nensure absolute precision, but only guarantee that refreshes do not execute before their set interval occurs (e.g. in the\ncurrent example, the refresh could first run at 9:14 AM, but will definitely not run at 9:12 AM).",
        "Note",
        "The maximum supported value is 11520 (8 days). If the replication schedule has a greater num MINUTE value, the\nrefresh operation never runs.",

        "If there are account objects (e.g. users or roles) in a target account that you do not want to drop during replication,\nuse the SYSTEM$LINK_ACCOUNT_OBJECTS_BY_NAME system function to apply a global identifier to objects\ncreated by means other than replication. For more information, see\nApply Global IDs to Objects Created by Scripts in Target Accounts before\nyou create a replication group.",
        "Automatically scheduled refresh operations are executed using the role with the OWNERSHIP\nprivilege on the group. If a scheduled refresh operation fails due to insufficient privileges, grant the required privileges\nto the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the group.",
        "If you create a replication or failover group with a tag or modify a replication or failover group by setting a tag on it,\ntag lineage does not apply to any objects that you specify in the replication or failover group.",
        "Tag lineage is only applicable to objects with a parent-child relationship, such\ndatabase, schema, and table. There are no child objects of replication or failover groups.",
        "You cannot set a tag or modify a tag on a secondary replication or failover group because these objects are read\nonly.",
