        "This topic describes how to use Microsoft Power BI to instantiate a Snowflake session and access Snowflake using single sign-on (SSO).",
        "Snowflake allows Microsoft Power BI users to connect to Snowflake using Identity Provider credentials and an OAuth 2.0 implementation to\nprovide an SSO experience to access Snowflake data.",
        "This feature eliminates the need for on-premises Power BI Gateway implementations since the Power BI service uses an embedded Snowflake\ndriver to connect to Snowflake.",
        "The following diagram summarizes the authorization flow to instantiate a Snowflake session from Power BI:",
        "The user logs into the Power BI service using Microsoft Entra ID.",
        "Optionally, Microsoft Entra ID can verify the user through an IdP via SAML. Currently, Microsoft only supports Microsoft Entra ID as the IdP for Power BI SSO.",
        "When the user connects to Snowflake, the Power BI service asks Microsoft Entra ID to give it a token for Snowflake.",
        "The Power BI service uses the embedded Snowflake driver to send the Microsoft Entra ID token to Snowflake as part of the connection string.",
        "Snowflake validates the token, extracts the username from the token, maps it to the Snowflake user, and creates a Snowflake session for\nthe Power BI service using the user\u2019s default role.",
        "For your Snowflake account, please verify the following before using the Power BI SSO feature:",
        "In Snowflake, if you\u2019re using Controlling network traffic with network policies, you should allow the Azure IP range that includes the Azure region where your Snowflake account is hosted\nand any additional Azure regions as necessary.",
        "Important",
        "To create a network policy that is specific to Power BI for the Azure region where your Snowflake on\nAzure account is located, search the JSON download from Microsoft for your region.",
        "For example, if your Snowflake on Azure account is located in the Canada Central region, search the JSON download for\nPowerBI.CanadaCentral. Select the IP address ranges from the addressPrefixes list. Use these IP address ranges to\ncreate or update a network policy in Snowflake.",
        "If the addressPrefixes list is empty, please contact Microsoft to request an update.",
        "If you are using multiple Microsoft Azure services (e.g. Power BI, SCIM), contact your Azure administrator to verify the correct IP\naddress ranges to ensure the Snowflake network policy contains the correct IP address ranges to allow users to access Snowflake.",
        "Either the login_name, name, or the email attribute for the user in Snowflake must map to the Microsoft Entra ID\nupn attribute. If the login_name attribute is not defined, then the process defaults to the name attribute.",
        "Private connectivity to the Snowflake service is supported. If it is necessary to use any of these two services to connect to Snowflake,\nuse the on-premises gateway to connect.",
        "Private connectivity to the Snowflake service is not supported. For the Power BI Service and Power BI Desktop, create a network policy to\nallow the Microsoft Entra ID public IP address ranges. Note that network policies have a 100,000 character limit for the allowed IP\naddresses.",
        "Snowflake tries to verify Microsoft Entra ID through the URL value in the external_oauth_jws_keys_url property (shown below)\nor through the allowed IP addresses in the network policy, if the network policy exists. Microsoft updates its tokens and keys every 24\nhours. For more information on the Microsoft updates, see\nOverview of tokens in Microsoft Entra ID B2C.",
        "By default, the ACCOUNTADMIN, ORGADMIN, and SECURITYADMIN system roles are blocked from using Microsoft Power BI to instantiate a\nSnowflake session. If it is necessary to use these highly privileged roles, update the EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ALLOWED_ROLES security\nintegration parameter to specify these roles. Exercise caution before specifying the ACCOUNTADMIN, ORGADMIN, and SECURITYADMIN system\nroles in the EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ALLOWED_ROLES security integration parameter.",
        "For more information, see CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION and ALTER SECURITY INTEGRATION.",
        "This section explains how to create a Power BI security integration in Snowflake and how to access Snowflake through Power BI.",
        "Note",
        "This step is not required if you are using the Power BI gateway for Power BI service to connect to Snowflake or are using your Snowflake\nusername and password for authentication.",
        "To use Power BI to access Snowflake data through SSO, it is necessary to create a security integration for Power BI using\nCREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION as shown below.",
        "The security integration must have the correct value for the external_oauth_issuer parameter. Part of this value maps to your\nMicrosoft Entra tenant. You can find this value in the About section of your Power BI tenant.",
        "If your organization has an advanced deployment of the Power BI service, then check with your Microsoft Entra ID administrator to get the correct\nvalue of the Microsoft Entra tenant to use in constructing the Issuer URL.",
        "For example, if your Microsoft Entra tenant ID is a828b821-f44f-4698-85b2-3c6749302698, then construct the AZURE_AD_ISSUER value\nsimilar to https://sts.windows.net/a828b821-f44f-4698-85b2-3c6749302698/. It is important to include the forward slash (i.e.\n/) at the end of the value.",
        "After constructing the value for AZURE_AD_ISSUER, execute the CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION command.",
        "If your Snowflake account or Microsoft Power BI service is in the Microsoft Azure Government cloud region, set\nthe external_oauth_audience_list property value to https://analysis.usgovcloudapi.net/powerbi/connector/Snowflake.",
        "Security integration for Microsoft Power BI",
        "Microsoft Azure Government security integration for Microsoft Power BI",
        "Important",
        "Only account administrators (i.e. users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) or a role with the global CREATE INTEGRATION privilege can execute\nthis SQL command.",
        "The security integration parameter values are case-sensitive, and the values you put into the security integration must match those\nvalues in your environment. If the case does not match, it is possible that the access token will not be validated, resulting in a failed authentication attempt.",
        "The list values that you specify for the EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST property are URLs with an uppercase and lowercase Snowflake\nname. Include both URLs in this list to ensure that your client can connect to Snowflake based on the values that Microsoft might expect\nto form a connection.",
        "Verify that all parameter values are an exact match. For example, if the <AZURE_AD_ISSUER> URL value does not end with a\nbackslash and the security integration is created with a backslash character at the end of the URL, an error message will occur. It would\nthen be necessary to drop the security integration object (using DROP INTEGRATION) and then create the object again with the correct URL\nvalue (using CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION).",
        "In your environment, if the user\u2019s UPN\nattribute value\nmatches the user\u2019s email field instead of the login_name in Snowflake, then replace login_name with\nemail_address. For example:",
        "To allow Microsoft Entra ID business to business (i.e. B2B) guest users to access Snowflake using SSO from Microsoft Power BI, set the\nEXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM property value to 'unique_name'. For example:",
        "For more information, see Understand the B2B User.",
        "You can update your External OAuth security integration by executing an ALTER statement on the security integration.",
        "For more information, see ALTER SECURITY INTEGRATION (External OAuth).",
        "The desired scope for the primary role is passed in the external token. This role is a specific role that was granted to the user (session:role:<role_name>).",
        "By default, the default secondary roles for a user (i.e. the DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES user\nproperty) are not activated in the session.",
        "To activate the default secondary roles for a user in a session and allow executing the USE SECONDARY ROLES\ncommand while using External OAuth, complete this step:",
        "Configure the security integration for the connection. Set the EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ANY_ROLE_MODE parameter value to either ENABLE or\nENABLE_FOR_PRIVILEGE when you create the security integration (using CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION) or later (using ALTER SECURITY\nINTEGRATION).",
        "Snowflake supports using Client Redirect with Power BI SSO to Snowflake.",
        "For more information, see Redirecting client connections.",
        "Snowflake supports replication and failover/failback of the External OAuth security integration from a source account to a target account.",
        "For details, see Replication of security integrations & network policies across multiple accounts.",

        "Power BI Desktop documentation",
        "Power BI Service documentation",
        "Currently, network policies cannot be added to an External OAuth security integration, which means that you cannot define a network policy\nthat applies only to the Power BI integration. However, you can still implement network policies that apply broadly to the entire\nSnowflake account. For information about the Microsoft IP range that should be included in the network policy, see the Prerequisites\nsection (in this topic).",
        "Warehouse resumption. If a given user attempts to use a suspended warehouse, Microsoft Power BI displays an error message that is not\ndescribed in Error Messages. Verify, and if necessary, configure the warehouse to resume automatically to resolve the error message.\nFor more information, see  Starting or resuming a warehouse.",
