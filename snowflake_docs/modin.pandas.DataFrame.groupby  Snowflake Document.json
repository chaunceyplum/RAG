If a dict or Snowpark pandas Series is\npassed, the Series or dict VALUES will be used to determine the groups (the Series\u2019 values are first aligned;\nsee .align() method). If a list or ndarray of length equal to the selected axis is passed (see the groupby\nuser guide), the values are used as-is to determine the groups. A label or list of labels may be passed\nto group by the columns in self. Notice that a tuple is interpreted as a (single) key.",
