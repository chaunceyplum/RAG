        "This behavior change is in the 2024_06 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "When this behavior change bundle is enabled, the output of the SHOW COMPUTE POOLS and DESCRIBE COMPUTE POOL command includes the following new columns:",
        "Column name",
        "Description",
        "BUDGET",
        "The name of the budget monitoring the credit usage of the compute pool.",
        "TARGET_NODES",
        "Indicates the number of nodes that Snowflake is targeting for your compute pool. If active_nodes is not equal to the\ntarget_nodes, then Snowflake will autoscale the cluster to add or remove the nodes",
        "Note",
        "The target_nodes column appears immediately after the existing idle_nodes column.",
        "The following examples demonstrate how to interpret the values in the target_nodes column.",
        "Example 1: Suppose in a CREATE COMPUTE POOL command, you specify MIN_NODES=1 and MAX_NODES=3.",
        "While Snowflake is provisioning a node, initially the value in the active_nodes and idle_nodes columns is 0, and the value in the target_nodes column is 1. (The value in the target_nodes column is the same as the value that you specified for the MIN_NODES parameter.) This indicates that there should be one node in the compute pool that Snowflake is provisioning.",
        "After Snowflake provisions one node, the value in the idle_nodes column is 1 (assuming that there are no services running). The value in the target_nodes column is still 1, indicating there should be one node in the compute pool.",
        "Example 2: Snowflake might try to add a node to an existing compute pool due to autoscaling or changes to the minimum number of nodes (through\nALTER COMPUTE POOL \u2026 SET MIN_NODES).",
        "While Snowflake is provisioning a node, the value in the state column is resizing. To determine how many nodes Snowflake is adding, check the value in the target_nodes column.",
        "For example, suppose that the value in the, active_nodes column is 1, the value in the idle_nodes column is 0, and you resize the compute pool by updating the MIN_NODES property from 1 to 2. In this case, the value in the target_nodes column as 2 (the number of nodes that should be in the compute pool). From this you can infer that Snowflake is provisioning one additional node.",
