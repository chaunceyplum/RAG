        "Lists all the database roles in the specified database.",
        "Important",
        "A user with any active role that has been granted any privilege on the active database (e.g. USAGE) can list the database roles in the\ndatabase. However, this does not necessarily mean the role allows users to use the database roles to perform SQL actions. To use a\ndatabase role, it must first be granted to an account role that users can activate in a user session, or to an account role lower in a\nhierarchy.",
        "This is a part of Discretionary Access Control and Role-Based Access Control. For more information, see\nOverview of Access Control.",
        "Tip",
        "In addition to SQL, you can also use other interfaces, such as Snowflake REST APIs, Snowflake Python APIs, and Snowflake CLI.\nSee Alternate interfaces.",
        "SHOW GRANTS , CREATE DATABASE ROLE ,  ALTER DATABASE ROLE ,  DROP DATABASE ROLE",
        "Specifies the name of the database.",
        "The command returns an error if you do not specify the name identifier.",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",
        "The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "The string does not have to include the full object name; partial names are supported.",
        "Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output)",
        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'B' LIMIT ... FROM 'A' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'AB' would return results (if any rows match the input strings).",
        "This command only supports showing database roles in a specific database.",
        "You cannot use this command to show database roles in the account.",
        "The command does not require a running warehouse to execute.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",
