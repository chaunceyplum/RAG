        "Snowflake does not charge a data ingress fee to bring data into your account, but does charge a per-byte fee to transfer data from a\nSnowflake account into another region on the same cloud platform or into a different cloud platform.",
        "This topic describes how to gain insight into historical data transfer costs using Snowsight, or by writing queries against\nviews in the ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE schemas.\nSnowsight allows you to quickly and easily obtain information about cost from a visual dashboard. Queries against the usage views\nallow you to drill down into cost data and can help generate custom reports and dashboards.",
        "To gain a better understanding of how data transfer fees accrue, see Understanding data transfer cost.",
        "Users can use Snowsight to view the amount of data transferred from your Snowflake account to\na different cloud provider or region within a specified date range. The unit of measure is bytes.",

        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "Switch to the ACCOUNTADMIN role. If you are not the account administrator, switch to a role with access to cost and usage data.",
        "Navigate to Admin \u00bb Cost Management.",
        "Select a warehouse to use to view the usage data. Snowflake recommends using an XS warehouse for this purpose.",
        "Select Consumption.",
        "Select Data Transfer from the Usage Type drop-down.",
        "For usage notes related to the Consumption page, see Usage notes.",
        "Snowflake provides two schemas, ORGANIZATION_USAGE and\nACCOUNT_USAGE, that contain data related to usage and cost. The ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema provides\ncost information for all of the accounts in the organization while the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema provides similar information for a single\naccount. Views in these schemas provide granular, analytics-ready usage data to build custom reports or dashboards.",
        "Most views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE and ACCOUNT_USAGE schemas contain the cost of data transfers in terms of the volume of data\ntransferred. To view cost in currency rather than volume, write queries against the\nUSAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY view. This view converts the volume of data transferred into cost in currency\nusing the daily price of transferring a TB.",
