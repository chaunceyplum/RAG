        "Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL\nwildcard characters (% and _).",
        "For example, the following patterns return the same results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Specifies the scope of the command, which determines whether the command lists records only for the current/specified database or\nacross your entire account.",
        "The DATABASE keyword is not required; you can set the scope by specifying only the database name. Likewise, the database name\nis not required if the session currently has a database in use.",
        "Default: Depends on whether the session currently has a database in use:",
        "Database: DATABASE is the default (i.e. the command returns the objects you have privileges to view in the database).",
        "No database: ACCOUNT is the default (i.e. the command returns the objects you have privileges to view in your account).",
        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "For example, the following strings return different results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output)",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",
        "The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "The string does not have to include the full object name; partial names are supported.",
        "Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output)",
        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'B' LIMIT ... FROM 'A' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'AB' would return results (if any rows match the input strings).",
        "The owner and owner_role_type columns do not return a value.",
        "The command does not require a running warehouse to execute.",
        "The value for LIMIT rows cannot exceed 10000. If LIMIT rows is omitted, the command results in an error if the result set is larger than 10K rows.",
        "To view results for which more than 10K records exist, either include LIMIT rows or query the corresponding view in the Snowflake Information Schema.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",
