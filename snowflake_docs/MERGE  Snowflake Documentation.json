        "Inserts, updates, and deletes values in a table based on values in a second table or a subquery. This can be useful if the second table\nis a change log that contains new rows (to be inserted), modified rows (to be updated), and/or marked rows (to be deleted) in the target\ntable.",

        "Specifies the table to merge.",
        "Specifies the table or subquery to join with the target table.",
        "Specifies the expression on which to join the target table and source.",
        "Specifies the action to perform when the values match.",
        "Optionally specifies an expression which, when true, causes the matching case to be executed.",
        "Default: No value (matching case is always executed)",
        "Specifies the column within the target table to be updated or inserted and the corresponding expression for the new column value\n(can refer to both the target and source relations).",

        "Any matching or not-matching clause that omits the AND subclause (default behavior) must be the last of its clause\ntype in the statement (e.g. a WHEN MATCHED ... clause cannot be followed by a WHEN MATCHED AND ... clause). Doing\nso results in an unreachable case, which returns an error.",
        "When a merge joins a row in the target table against multiple rows in the source, the following join conditions produce nondeterministic\nresults (i.e. the system is unable to determine the source value to use to update or delete the target row):",
        "A target row is selected to be updated with multiple values (e.g. WHEN MATCHED ... THEN UPDATE).",
        "A target row is selected to be both updated and deleted (e.g. WHEN MATCHED ... THEN UPDATE , WHEN MATCHED ... THEN DELETE).",

        "If TRUE (default value), the merge returns an error.",
        "If FALSE, one row from among the duplicates is selected to perform the update or delete; the row selected is not defined.",
        "Deterministic merges always complete without error. A merge is deterministic if it meets the following conditions for each target row:",
        "One or more source rows satisfy the WHEN MATCHED ... THEN DELETE clauses, and no other source rows satisfy any\nWHEN MATCHED clauses",
        "OR",
        "Exactly one source row satisfies a WHEN MATCHED ... THEN UPDATE clause, and no other source rows satisfy any\nWHEN MATCHED clauses.",
        "This makes MERGE semantically equivalent to the UPDATE and DELETE commands.",
        "Note",
        "To avoid errors when multiple rows in the data source (i.e. the source table or subquery) match the target table based on the ON\ncondition, use GROUP BY in the source clause to ensure that each target row joins against one row\n(at most) in the source.",
        "In the following example, assume src includes multiple rows with the same k value. It\u2019s ambiguous which values (v) will\nbe used to update rows in the target row with the same value of k.  By using MAX() and GROUP BY, the query clarifies exactly\nwhich value of v from src is used:",
        "Deterministic merges always complete without error.",
        "If the MERGE contains a WHEN NOT MATCHED ... THEN INSERT clause, and if there are no matching rows in the target, and if the\nsource contains duplicate values, then the target gets one copy of the row for each copy in the source. (An example is included\nbelow.)",
