        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned night be less than the specified limit (e.g. the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit).",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",
        "The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive. In addition, the string does not have to include the full\nobject name; partial names are supported.",
        "Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output).",
        "For example:",
        "The statement returns up to ten application roles in the application named myapp after the first application role named\napp_role2.",
