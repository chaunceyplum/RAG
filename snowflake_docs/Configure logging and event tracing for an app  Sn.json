        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "This topic describes how providers can configure a Snowflake Native App to record log messages and trace events.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework supports using the Snowflake logging and tracing\nfunctionality to gather information about an app. Providers can configure an app to record and analyze the following:",
        "Log messages \u2014 Independent, detailed messages with information about\nthe state of a specific piece app code.",
        "Trace events \u2014 Structured data that providers can\nuse to get information spanning and grouping multiple parts of your code.  Trace events allows an app to emit information related\nto its performance and behavior.",
        "To configure an app to emit log messages and trace events, providers set the log and trace levels in the manifest file.\nSee Set the log and trace levels for an app.",
        "Providers can also configure an app to use event sharing to allow the consumer to share the log messages\nand trace events with the provider. See  About event sharing for\nmore information.",
        "Event sharing allows the provider to collect information about an app\u2019s performance and behavior.\nA provider can configure an app to request that the consumers share the log messages\nand trace events with the provider. Event sharing requires that the provider and consumer configure an\nevent table in their account to store the log messages and trace events emitted by the app.",
        "When event sharing is enabled, the log messages and trace events that are inserted into the event table in the\nconsumer account are also inserted into the event table in provider account.",
        "Before configuring logging and event sharing for an app, providers must consider the following:",
        "Providers are responsible for all costs associated with event sharing on the provider side, including data\ningestion and storage.",
        "Providers must have an account to store shared events\nin each region where you want to support event sharing.",
        "Providers must define the default log level and trace level for an app in the manifest file.",
        "Note",
        "Event sharing cannot be enabled for an app that is installed in the same account as the application package\nit is based on. To test event sharing for an app, providers must use multiple accounts.",
        "When migrating from the existing event sharing functionality to use event definitions, providers\nshould consider the following.",
        "The previous event sharing functionality is equivalent to the OPTIONAL ALL event definition.",
        "Published versions and patches of an app that used the previous functionality will have the\nOPTIONAL ALL event definition by default. Providers do not need to add this event definition\nto the manifest file.",
        "To begin using event definitions, providers can add supported event definitions to the manifest\nfile. This is applicable to new apps as well as new versions and patches of existing apps.",
        "Note",
        "To being begin requesting more granular log and event sharing, providers only have to add\nevent definitions to the manifest file. No other actions are required for providers.",
        "Event sharing allows consumers to share log messages and trace events with the provider.",
        "The following workflow shows how to set up and enable event sharing for an app:",
        "The provider sets the log and trace levels\nfor the app.",
        "The provider adds event definitions to the manifest file.",
        "Event definitions act as filters on the log messages and trace events emitted by the app.\nProviders can configure event definitions to be required or optional.",
        "The provider sets up an event table\nin their organization.",
        "The provider publishes the app.",
        "When a consumer installs an app, they can set up an event table and enable event sharing.\nSee Enable logging and event sharing for an app\nfor more information on the consumer requirements for event sharing.",
