        "The view provides daily block storage and snapshot usage within the last 365 days (1 year) for an account.",
        "Snapshots are not associated with compute pools; therefore, for snapshots the view has the NULL value in the COMPUTE_POOL_NAME column.",
        "The BYTES column shows average usage of block storage volumes for a specific day, for a specific storage type, and for a specific compute pool (where appropriate) in the Snowflake account. For example, consider the following:",
        "You use a 10 GB block volume for 6 hours on 2024-02-01 for compute pool POOL_1. Using 10 GB for 6 hours is equivalent to 2.5 GB per day\n(10 GB * 6/24 hours = 2.5 GB = 2500000000 bytes per day).",
        "You use a 10 GB block volume for 12 hours on 2024-02-01 for another compute pool POOL_2. Using 10 GB for 12 hours is equivalent to 5 GB per day\n(10 GB * 12/24 hours = 5 GB = 5000000000 bytes per day).",
        "You use a 20 GB snapshot for 24 hours on 2024-02-01. Using 20 GB for 24 hours is equivalent to 20 GB (20000000000 bytes) per day.",
        "Suppose that you query the BLOCK_STORAGE_HISTORY view:",
        "The query returns the following results:",
        "Note",
        "If you attach multiple block volumes to a compute pool, the view aggregates the usage and returns one row.",
        "If there are multiple snapshots present on a given day, the view aggregates the usage and returns one row.",
        "If you attach a single block volume to a compute pool and use it for three days, then the view returns three rows because the view reports daily usage for each compute pool having block volumes attached.",
