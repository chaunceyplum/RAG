        "This topic describes how to manage delegated authorizations for OAuth, that is, user consent given to one or more clients associated with\nSnowflake integrations for a specified role.",
        "Adding a delegated authorization to a user pre-authorizes consent to initiate a session using a specified role for a particular\nintegration. Without the delegated authorization, the user must authorize consent for the role after authentication. Note that a delegated\nauthorization only bypasses the authorization step for a given role; a user must always authenticate to request an authorization code.",
        "The ability to add delegated authorizations is limited to custom clients. For public clients (that is, Tableau Cloud or Desktop), Snowflake\nalways displays the confirmation dialog for a given role.",
