        "With this release, in a SELECT * statement, you can specify ILIKE with a pattern containing SQL wildcards (_ to match a\nsingle character and % to match any sequence of zero or more characters) to select only the columns that match that pattern.\nThe ILIKE keyword performs case-insensitive matching.",
        "For example, to select only the columns with names containing id:",
        "In addition, you can replace the values of specific columns in a SELECT * statement by specifying REPLACE with an expression that evaluates\nto the new value:",
        "For example, to prepend the string 'DEPT-' to each value in the department_id column:",

        "The following example creates a POINT GEOMETRY object that uses EPSG:32633 (WGS 84 / UTM zone 33N) as the SRS. The example transforms this\nGEOMETRY object to use EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator).",
        "For more information, see ST_TRANSFORM.",

        "Vectorized Python UDTFs enable seamless partition-by-partition processing by operating on partitions as pandas DataFrames and returning\nresults as pandas DataFrames or lists of pandas Series or arrays. Vectorized Python UDTFs allow for easy integration with libraries that\noperate on pandas DataFrames or pandas arrays.",

        "Starting in August 2023:",
        "We will no longer aggregate the Release Notes (in the Snowflake Documentation) by month. Instead,\nwe will document each weekly release separately by version and release dates, effectively replicating the format of the Release Notes\nin the Snowflake Community.",
