        "The following new features, behavior changes, and updates (enhancements, fixes, etc.) have been introduced this month. If you have any\nquestions about these additions, please contact\nSnowflake Support.",
        "Important",
        "Each release may include updates that require the web interface to be refreshed.",
        "As a general practice, to ensure these updates do not impact your usage, we recommend refreshing the web interface after each Snowflake\nrelease has been deployed.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of\nAccount Replication. This feature uses\nreplication groups and failover groups to replicate objects with point-in-time consistency\nfrom a source account to one or more target accounts. A replication group allows customers to specify which account objects to replicate, to\nwhich regions or cloud platforms, at customizable scheduled intervals. A failover group provides the same functionality as a replication\ngroup and can additionally failover the objects in a group.",
        "Account objects can include warehouses, users, and roles, along with databases and shares (refer to\nReplicated Objects for the full list of objects that can be included in a replication or failover group).\nAccount objects can be grouped in one or multiple groups.",
        "In the case of failover, account replication enables the failover of your entire account to a different region or cloud platform. Each\nreplication and failover group has its own replication schedule, allowing you to set the frequency for replication at different intervals\nfor different groups of objects. In the case of failover groups, it also enables failover of groups individually. You can choose to failover\nall failover groups, or only select failover groups.",
        "For more information, refer to Introduction to replication and failover across multiple accounts.",
        "With this release, Snowflake is pleased to announce a preview of user-defined functions (UDFs) with a handler written in Scala.",
        "For more information, refer to Introduction to Scala UDFs.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce a preview of tabular stored procedures with a handler written in Python. You can write a\nprocedure that returns data in tabular form. To do this, you specify the procedure\u2019s return type as TABLE (specifying columns for the return\nvalue), then have your handler code return the tabular value in a Snowpark dataframe.",
        "For more information, refer to Python.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce upgraded encryption functions, ENCRYPT() and ENCRYPT_RAW(), which can be used by customers\nto provide an additional layer of protection to user-provided values.  The upgrades to both function were implemented as part of our\ncommitment to continuous improvement for our customers. Customers will get the benefit of these enhancements in all subsequent invocations\nof the encryption functions.",
        "For more information, refer to Encryption functions.",
        "With this release, Snowflake adds support to set or unset a tag on a masking, password, row access, and session policy using an ALTER\nstatement.",
        "Set a tag using the ALTER statement:",
        "The ALTER \u2026 SET statement specifies the tag name (i.e. the key) and the tag value.",
        "The tag value is always a string, and the maximum number of characters for the tag value is 256.",
        "For more information, refer to Tag quotas for objects and columns.",
        "Unset a tag using the ALTER statement:",
        "The ALTER \u2026 UNSET statement specifies the tag name only.",
        "Set policy_kind to one of the following policies:",
        "MASKING",
        "PASSWORD",
        "ROW ACCESS",
        "SESSION",
        "In the following GEOMETRY constructor functions, you can now specify the SRID as an argument:",
        "TO_GEOMETRY",
        "TRY_TO_GEOMETRY",
        "ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKB",
        "ST_GEOMETRYFROMWKT",
        "The following example passes the SRID 4326 to the TO_GEOMETRY function:",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce that search optimization and query acceleration can work together to optimize query\nperformance.",
        "Search optimization can prune the micro-partitions not needed for a query. For eligible queries, query acceleration can offload parts of the\nremaining work to shared compute resources provided by the service.",
        "The performance of queries accelerated by both services varies depending on workload and available resources.",
        "For more information, refer to:",
        "Search Optimization Service",
        "Using the Query Acceleration Service",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of enabling the Search Optimization Service for a specific column of\na table. Two related features that estimate the cost of enabling search optimization on a column and that display the search optimization\nconfiguration for a specified table and its columns are also now generally available.",
        "In addition, the Search Optimization Service now supports the following types of predicates:",
        "Predicates that use string patterns (e.g. LIKE, ILIKE, etc.) and POSIX regular expressions (e.g. RLIKE, REGEXP).",
        "Predicates that use fields in VARIANT, ARRAY, and OBJECT columns.",
        "Predicates that use geospatial functions such as ST_INTERSECTS, ST_CONTAINS, ST_WITHIN, ST_DWITHIN, ST_COVERS, and ST_COVEREDBY against\nGEOGRAPHY columns.",
        "For more information, refer to:",
        "Enabling search optimization for specific columns",

        "With this release, we are pleased to complete the cross-platform support for Snowpipe auto-ingest. Triggering automated Snowpipe data loads\nusing S3 event messages, GCS Pub/Sub event messages, and Azure Event Grid messages are now supported by Snowflake accounts hosted on\nany supported cloud platforms.",
        "For more information, refer to Automating Continuous Data Loading Using Cloud Messaging.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the Amazon EventBridge support for Snowpipe auto-ingest. You can set up Amazon EventBridge for\nSnowpipe auto-ingest by following the steps in\nAutomating Snowpipe for Amazon S3 with SNS.",
        "With this release, Snowpipe auto-ingest now supports the SftpCommit API for Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated events to automatically retrieve\nand load files created through SFTP. For more information, refer to\nAutomating Snowpipe for Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.",

        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of using secondary roles to access functionality in\nSnowsight.",
        "If you set the DEFAULT_SECONDARY_ROLES user property to ALL, secondary roles are activated when the user signs in to Snowflake.",
        "When secondary roles are active, you do not need to switch roles or manually activate secondary roles to access pages in Snowsight\nthat your primary role, or a role in its hierarchy, cannot access. You can use your primary role to perform actions such as using worksheets\nwith a specific role, but still easily access other pages in Snowsight.",
        "For more information, refer to Active roles and CREATE USER.",
        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the preview of loading files into stages using Snowsight.",
