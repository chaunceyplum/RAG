        "The NO_PROXY defines the hosts that a client can use to connect directly without going through the proxy server.",
        "You can identify the specific URL that is experiencing connectivity issues. While it is beneficial to test all URLs listed in the Snowflake allowlist, you might want to focus on the URL that is directly causing issues in your setup.",

        "These commands configure your environment to use the proxy for HTTP and HTTPS requests and attempt to connect to the specified Snowflake URL. It also outputs detailed information about the connection attempt, including any successful connections or errors encountered.",
