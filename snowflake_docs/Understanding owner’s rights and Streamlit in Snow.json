    "paragraphs": [
        "The model for Streamlit in Snowflake closely maps to the owner\u2019s rights model in\nstored procedures. This eliminates\nthe need for service account tokens and integrates with the authentication, access control,\nand network policy features that Snowflake provides.",
        "Streamlit apps adhere to the following rules within a session:",
        "Run with the privileges of the owner, not the privileges of the caller.",
        "Run with the warehouse provisioned by the app owner.",
        "Use the database and schema that the Streamlit in Snowflake app was created in, not the database and\nschema that the caller is currently using.",
        "The privilege to create a Streamlit app is granted at the schema level.",
        "To create and edit a Streamlit app by using Streamlit in Snowflake, you must use a role that has either the OWNERSHIP privilege on the schema, or both of the following privileges:",
        "Granted on the database that contains the Streamlit app:",
        "USAGE",
        "Granted on the schema that contains the Streamlit app:",
        "USAGE",
        "CREATE STREAMLIT",
        "CREATE STAGE",
        "You must also have the USAGE privilege on the warehouse used to run the Streamlit app.",
        "When a Streamlit app is created, it runs with the role of the user who originally created\nthe app.",
        "The app owner can choose which roles have permission to use the app.",
        "Viewers can interact with the app and see anything displayed on the screen.",
        "All of the app owner role\u2019s privileges can be used by the app when shared with other roles, regardless of whether the privilege has WITH GRANT enabled.",
        "Because apps run with owner\u2019s rights, they have several additional restrictions. These restrictions affect the following:",
        "The built-in functions that can be called from inside a stored procedure are not available\nwhen a stored procedure is called in a Streamlit app.",
        "The ability to execute ALTER USER statements.",
        "The types of SQL statements that can be called from inside a stored procedure.",
        "Some DESCRIBE commands.",
        "For more information, see Additional restrictions on owner\u2019s rights stored procedures.",
        "Streamlit apps running in Streamlit in Snowflake run with owner\u2019s rights and follow the same security model as other\nSnowflake objects that run with owner\u2019s rights.",
        "Although Snowflake provides security features like authentication, role-based access control, and\nadmin controls, responsibility for the security of apps is shared with app creators and owners.",
        "Use caution, for example, when granting a role with write privileges to another Snowflake user. Write\nprivileges allow the user to modify the Streamlit app.",
        "In general, Snowflake recommends using role-based access control and dedicated roles for creating and\nviewing Streamlit apps. Additionally, you should follow appropriate security practices while developing\nStreamlit apps inside Snowflake and perform regular security audits of the Streamlit apps in your account.",
