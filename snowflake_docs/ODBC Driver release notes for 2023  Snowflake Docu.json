        "This article contains the release notes for the ODBC Driver, including the following when applicable:",
        "Behavior changes",
        "New features",
        "Customer-facing bug fixes",
        "Snowflake uses semantic versioning for ODBC Driver updates.",
        "See ODBC Driver for documentation.",
        "None.",
        "Added the BROWSER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT connection parameter to fix an issue with external browser authentication.",
        "Added the allowEmptyProxy connection parameter to fix an issue where an empty proxy setting could overwrite the configuration setting.",
        "Fixed an issue that caused intermittent crashes when sending telemetry data.",
        "Removed CRT functions banned by Microsoft due to security concerns.",
        "Updated the following libraries:",
        "openssl from 3.0.9 to 3.0.11",
        "curl from 8.1.2 to 8.4.0",
        "Updated SQLGetStmtAttr(SQL_SF_STMT_ATTR_LAST_QUERY_ID) to return the query id for failed query.",
        "Added support for managing the frequency of retries for unsuccessful connection requests:",
        "Added the retryTimeout parameter with a default value of 300 seconds.",
        "Updated how the driver uses the LOGIN_TIMEOUT and maxHttpRetries connection parameters and changed the default value  of LOGIN_TIMEOUT to 300 seconds.",
        "Fixed an issue where the driver failed when fetching query results due to a timeout in OSCP validation.",
        "Fixed an issue where PUT and GET commands failed when a file path contained non-ASCII characters.",
        "Fixed an issue where a PUT command on GCP overwrote existing files when overwrite=true is not specified.",
        "Removed CRT functions banned by Microsoft due to security concerns.",
        "Updated the cacert bundle used for SSL connections.",
        "Improved error messages related to PUT/GET command failures to provide specific errors instead of \u201cunknown exception\u201d.",
        "Fixed an issue where the ODBC driver would continue retrying chunk downloads even after the application canceled the related query.",
        "Fixed an issue where using SQLGetData() with the ARROW result format could decrease performance.",
        "Fixed an issue where credentials were shown in error messages.",
        "Fixed an issue with OCSP fallback requests in AWS PrivateLink environments.",
        "Fixed an issue where the driver did not use the entire OCSP URL in the certificate when performing OCSP validation.",
        "Fixed an issue where, under certain conditions, the driver could retry HTTP requests indefinitely.",
        "Previously, during an outage the driver would retry the failed HTTP call continuously until the request succeeds or\nuntil someone force kills the operation.",
        "With this change, the driver disables infinite HTTP retries originating from execute and executeQuery calls. Now, the driver\nlimits HTTP retries to seven, by default. Customers can set the maxHttpRetries connection parameter to customize\nthe maximum number of retries. Customers can set maxHttpRetries=0 to remove the retry limit, but doing so runs the\nrisk of the driver infinitely retrying failed HTTP calls.",
        "To improve performance, the SQLExecDirect() function no longer unnecessarily validates parameter bindings for a query.",
        "Previously, the driver sent two requests for each SQLExecDirect() call: a describe request and an execute request.\nTo improve the performance describe request is omitted. With this change the driver won\u2019t validate the parameter\nbindings needed by the query. If the parameter bindings from the previous query are not cleared\nusing SQLFreeStmt(SQL_RESET_PARAMS), they could be applied to the following query incorrectly and cause\nissues.",
        "Added the CLIENT_OUT_OF_BAND_TELEMETRY_ENABLED session parameter to enable and disable out-of-band (OOB)\ntelemetry support.",
        "Fixed an issue where the driver might fail when getting a query result for mulit-statement queries that begin with new\nstatement types, such as CALL.",
        "Fixed an issue that could cause the SQLColAttribute() function to return an incorrect value\nof SQL_DESC_OCTET_LENGTH on VARCHAR columns, which could truncate data.",
        "Fixed an issue where the driver failed to download query results by incorrectly sending out-of-band (OOB) telemetry\ntimeouts when using private links.",
        "Updated the following software libraries:",
        "util-linux to version 2.39.0.",
        "curl to version 8.1.2.",
        "Enhanced hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP).",
        "Set the LogLevel default to OFF for ODBC clients running on Windows platforms.",
        "Fixed an issue that cause intermittent crashes when sending telemetry.",
        "Starting with version 3.0.1 of the ODBC driver:",
        "Upgraded from openssl 1.1.1 to openssl 3.0.9. Consequently, private keys generated using the deprecated encryption\nalgorithms in previous openssl library version no longer work. When you update to ODBC 3.0.1, you must regenerate\nyour private key file used for key pair authentication.",
        "Dropped support for CentOS 6 and MacOS 10.14 and 10.15.",
        "Updated the following software libraries:",
        "openssl to version 3.0.9.",
        "ICU to version 71.1.0.",
        "Created a single, unified release package architecture that supports both x86_64 and arm64 Mac systems.",
        "Fixed an issue where the driver crashed intermittently when CLIENT_SESSION_KEEP_ALIVE is set to true on Windows systems.",
        "None.",
        "Fixed an issue where very large requests with large amounts of parameter bindings could crash an application by\nexceeding the logging size.",
        "Fixed an issue with OCSP validation.",
        "Fixed an issue that could inadvertently reveal a proxy password in the Snowflake log file.",
        "Updated the libcurl library from version 7.87.0 to 7.88.1.",
        "Updated the zlib library from version 1.2.11 to 1.2.13.",
        "Fixed an invalid URL issue that could occur during OCSP validation when making connections.",
        "Fixed an issue where connections would fail when credentials were supplied when using proxies that do not need them.",
        "Removed deprecated openssl function calls.",
        "Fixed an issue where double type parameter bindings could lose precision.",
        "Removed unsafe function calls banned by Microsoft.",
        "Updated the libcurl library from version 7.84.0 to 7.87.0.",
        "Fixed an issue the prevented clients from creating a file DSN (data source name).",
        "Fixed an issue where the PUT command failed to replicated data.",
