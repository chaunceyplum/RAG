        "Leaked password protection is a background service in Snowflake that monitors and disables passwords that have been leaked to help prevent\nunauthorized access to Snowflake accounts. The leaked password protection service provides a notification system for administrators so they\nare aware of leaked passwords when they are detected in external databases.",
        "This topic provides the following information:",
        "Discovering leaked passwords",
        "Email notifications",
        "Types of users scanned",
        "Reset a user password",
        "Reset an admin password",
        "If Snowflake discovers a leaked password, then Snowflake identifies which user the password is associated with,\nand then securely verifies whether or not the user can still use the leaked password to authenticate.",
        "If the user can authenticate with the leaked password, Snowflake disables the leaked password by unsetting the password for the user, and\nrejecting the use of the leaked password by that user in the future. After disabling the leaked password, the user cannot authenticate using\ntheir password, but the user can use other methods of authentication, such as SSO, if available.",
        "Snowflake then notifies the administrator and user about the leaked password through email. Snowflake also provides a message to the\naffected user during login time, telling them they must contact their account administrator to send them a reset link to change their\npassword. The user\u2019s new password must meet the requirements of the password policies set on the account.",
        "If Snowflake identifies that the leaked password is an administrator password, and no other administrators can reset the password, the\nadministrator must contact Snowflake Support.",
        "Leaked password protection is enabled by default, and you cannot disable leaked password protection.",
        "Note",
        "Snowflake only processes passwords in-memory, and does not store passwords in cleartext. Snowflake employees cannot view passwords.",
        "When Snowflake discovers a leaked password, Snowflake attempts to notify email addresses in the following order:",
        "If one or more verified email addresses for account-level security notifications is\nfound, then Snowflake notifies the verified email addresses.",
        "If one or more verified email addresses for account-level security notifications are not found, then Snowflake attempts to look for and\nnotify email addresses at the organization level.",
        "If email addresses at the organization level are not found, Snowflake contacts users with admin roles.",
        "For more information about notification contacts for Snowflake, see Set up and manage notification contacts for Snowflake.",
        "All user types are scanned, and Snowflake can disable any user\u2019s password if the user has a password.",
        "If Snowflake blocks a user from authenticating with a password, then the user must ask their administrator to\nreset their password.",
        "If Snowflake blocks a user from authenticating with a password, then the user must ask their administrator to reset their password.",
        "If no other administrator is available to reset the password of another administrator, then the administrator must contact\nSnowflake Support.",
