        "L2 distance, also known as the Euclidean distance, is a measure of the distance between two vectors in a vector space. The\ndistance is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared differences of vector elements. The distance can be\na value of zero or higher. If the distance is zero, the vectors are identical. The larger the distance, the farther apart the\nvectors are.",
