        "Data Quality and data metric functions (DMFs) require Enterprise Edition. To inquire about upgrading, please contact\nSnowflake Support.",
        "Before trying each of the examples in this topic, be sure your role in use meets the necessary\naccess control requirements.",
        "Use the following syntax to call a DMF:",
        "Where:",
        "Specifies a system- or user-defined DMF.",
        "Specifies a SQL query on a table or view.",
        "The columns in the query must match the column arguments in the DMF signature.",
        "Note",
        "These system DMFs don\u2019t follow this syntax because they don\u2019t take any arguments:",
        "DATA_METRIC_SCHEDULED_TIME (system data metric function)",
        "ROW_COUNT (system data metric function)",
        "Call a system DMF to start measuring your data quality immediately.",
        "For example, call the NULL_COUNT (system data metric function) system DMF to view the number of NULL values\nin the SSN column (US Social Security number):",
        "You can query the event table to view the results. For information, see View the DMF results.",
        "Use the CREATE DATA METRIC FUNCTION command to create your own DMFs.",
        "Create a DMF that calls the COUNT function to return the total number of rows that\ndon\u2019t contain NULL values when evaluating the first three columns in the table:",
        "For an example that references a table other than the table to which you assign the DMF, see\nExample: Foreign key reference.",
        "Note",
        "If you need to view the DMF definition, use the DESCRIBE FUNCTION (DMF) command.",
        "Describe the DMF to view its properties:",
        "Make the DMF a secure DMF:",
        "Use the SHOW DATA METRIC FUNCTIONS or SHOW FUNCTIONS command to list DMFs\nin your account, database, or schema:",
        "Alternatively, you can query Information Schema FUNCTIONS view or the\nAccount Usage FUNCTIONS view to list your DMFs in the specified database or your account,\nrespectively.",
        "The is_data_metric column specifies whether the function is a DMF.",
        "Use the ALTER FUNCTION command to set a tag on a DMF:",
        "You can schedule your DMFs to run to automate the data quality measurements on a table.",
        "Snowflake uses the table owner role, which is the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the table, to call the scheduled DMF. The table\nowner role must have these grants:",
        "The USAGE privilege on the user-defined DMF, and the USAGE privilege on the database and schema that store the user-defined DMF.",
        "The DATA_METRIC_USER database role if the DMF is a system DMF.",
        "The EXECUTE DATA METRIC FUNCTION privilege on the account.",
        "The DATA_METRIC_SCHEDULE object parameter for a table, view, or materialized view enables you to schedule when your DMFs can\nrun. All data metric functions on the table or view follow the same schedule.",
        "There are three approaches to schedule your DMF to run:",
        "Set the DMF to run after a specified number of minutes.",
        "Use a cron expression to schedule the DMF to run at a particular frequency.",
        "Use a trigger event to schedule the DMF to run when there is a DML change to the table, such as\ninserting a new row into the table. However:",
        "The reclustering of tables doesn\u2019t trigger a DMF to run.",
        "The trigger approach is only available for certain kinds of tables. For more information, see\nALTER TABLE \u2026 SET DATA_METRIC_SCHEDULE.",
        "For example:",
        "Set the data metric function schedule to run every 5 minutes:",
        "Set the data metric function schedule to run at 8:00 AM daily:",
        "Set the data metric function schedule to run at 8:00 AM on weekdays only:",
        "Set the data metric function schedule to run three times daily at 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC:",
        "Set the data metric function to run when a general DML operation, such as inserting a new row, modifies the table:",
        "You can use the SHOW PARAMETERS command to view the DMF schedule for a supported table object:",
        "For view and materialized view objects, specify TABLE as the object domain and check the schedule as follows:",
        "Note",
        "There is a 10-minute lag from when you modify the DMF from a table for any scheduling changes to take effect on previous DMFs that are\nassigned to the table. However, new DMF assignments to the table are not subject to the 10 minute delay. Plan the DMF scheduling and DMF\nunsetting operations carefully to align with your expected DMF costs.",
        "Additionally, when you evaluate the DMF results, such as by querying the\nDATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS view, specify the measurement_time\ncolumn in your query as the basis for the evaluation. There is an internal process that initiates the DMF evaluation, and it is possible\nthat table updates, such as INSERT operations, can occur between the scheduled time and the measurement time. When you use the\nmeasurement_time column, you have a more accurate assessment of the DMF results because the measurement time indicates the\nevaluation time of the DMF.",
        "Use an ALTER TABLE or ALTER VIEW command to do the following:",
        "Add a DMF to a table using an ALTER TABLE.",
        "Drop a DMF from a table using an ALTER TABLE command.",
        "Note",
        "Use the ALTER VIEW command to add a DMF on a materialized view column or drop a DMF from a materialized view column.",
        "You can query the DATA_METRIC_FUNCTION_REFERENCES\nAccount Usage view to view DMF references in your account, or call the DATA_METRIC_FUNCTION_REFERENCES\nInformation Schema table function to identify the DMFs associated with a given table or view or the tables or views associated with a given\nDMF.",
        "For example:",
        "Return a row for each object (table or view) that has the DMF named count_positive_numbers set on that table or\nview:",
        "Return a row for each DMF assigned to the table named hr.tables.empl_info:",
        "Use the following syntax to call a DMF:",
        "Where:",
        "Specifies a system- or user-defined DMF.",
        "Specifies a SQL query on a table or view.",
        "The columns in the query must match the column arguments in the DMF signature.",

        "ROW_COUNT (system data metric function)",
        "Call the DMF directly and view the results:",
        "When you set a DMF on a table or view and schedule it to run, you can query the view built from the event table to view the results. For\ninformation, see View the DMF results.",
        "To view DMF results, you first need to manage access to the results and then choose how to view the results:",
        "Managing access to the DMF results",
        "Options",
        "You have three options to access the results of a scheduled DMF, which are detailed in the next section:",
        "Option 1: Query the dedicated event table.",
        "Option 2: Query the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS view, which is a\nflattened version of the event table.",
        "Option 3: Call the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS table function.",
        "Depending on how you want to manage access to the DMF results, grant the following system application roles to another account-level role:",
        "Application role",
        "Notes",
        "DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_ADMIN",
        "Can use options 1, 2, and 3.",
        "A role that is granted this application role can grant the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_VIEWER and DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_LOOKUP\napplication roles to other roles.",
        "A user that is granted the ACCOUNTADMIN role can grant the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_ADMIN application role to other roles.",

        "Use the REVOKE APPLICATION ROLE command to revoke the system application role from an account role.",
        "Tip",
        "Additionally, if you want to manage access to the results of system DMFs, grant the\nSNOWFLAKE.DATA_METRIC_USER database role to the account role that can access the results. For more information, see\nGRANT DATABASE ROLE.",
        "To view the scheduled DMF results, choose one of the following options:",
        "Option 1: Query the dedicated event table",
        "Option 2: Query the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS view",
        "Option 3: Call the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS table function",
        "This option gives you access to the raw data, and you have more freedom to post-process the data using derived objects, such as creating\nviews, table functions, or stored procedures based on how you want to analyze the results. Additionally, if you create these\nderived objects, you can selectively grant access on these objects to different roles. For example, a data engineer can access the stored\nprocedures to maintain the approach to obtain the results, and a data analyst can access the view to analyze the results.",
        "The event table is named SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL.DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS_RAW.",
        "For information about the event table columns, see Event table columns.",
        "For a representative example to query the event table, see the\nlogging and tracing tutorial.",
        "This option enables you to query the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS view, which flattens the raw data in the event table to enable\neasier access to the DMF results. Additionally, this option is best when data post-processing is not needed and when you don\u2019t want\nto grant access to the raw data.",
        "The view exists in the LOCAL schema in the shared SNOWFLAKE database: SNOWFLAKE.LOCAL.DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS.",
        "For information, see the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS view.",
        "Note",
        "The SNOWFLAKE.GOVERNANCE_VIEWER database role does not have access to query the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS view.",
        "This option enables you to call the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS table function to view the DMF\nresults. The function returns the same columns as the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS view. However, you can only specify a single table\nwhen calling the function. This option is best when you want to limit data metric function results to a single table and not provide\naccess to the measurements of other tables or the event table.",
        "In addition to the SNOWFLAKE.DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_LOOKUP application role, the role used to call the DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING_RESULTS\ntable function also needs the following privileges:",
