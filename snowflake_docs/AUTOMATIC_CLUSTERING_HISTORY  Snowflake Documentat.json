        "This table function is used for querying the Automatic Clustering history for given tables within a specified date range. The information returned by the function includes the\ncredits consumed, bytes updated, and rows updated each time a table is reclustered.",
        "All the arguments are optional.",
        "The date/time range to display the Automatic Clustering history.\nFor example, if you specify that the start date is 2019-04-03 and the end date is 2019-04-05, then you get data for\nApril 3, April 4, and April 5. (The endpoints are included.)",
        "If neither a start date nor an end date is specified, the default is the last 12 hours.",
        "If an end date is not specified, but a start date is specified, then CURRENT_DATE\nat midnight is used as the end of the range.",
        "If a start date is not specified, but an end date is specified, then the range starts 12 hours prior to the start\nof DATE_RANGE_END.",
        "Table name. If specified, only shows the history for the specified table.\nThe table name can include the schema name and the database name.",
        "If a table name is not specified, then the results include history for each table maintained by the\nAutomatic Clustering Service within the specified time range.",

        "Note",
        "A role with the MONITOR USAGE privilege can view per-object credit usage, but not object names. The role must also be granted SELECT on an object in order for its name to be returned by this function. If the role does not have sufficient privileges to see the object name, the object name might be displayed with a substitute name such as \u201cunknown_#\u201d, where \u201c#\u201d represents one or more digits.",
        "When calling an Information Schema table function, the session must have an INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema in use or the function name must be fully-qualified. For more details, see\nSnowflake Information Schema.",
