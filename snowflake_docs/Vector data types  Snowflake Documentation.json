        "With the VECTOR data type, Snowflake encodes and processes vectors efficiently. This data type supports semantic vector\nsearch and retrieval applications, such as RAG-based applications, and common operations on vectors in vector-processing applications.",
        "To specify a VECTOR type, use the following syntax:",
        "Where:",
        "type  is the Snowflake data type of the elements, which can be 32-bit integers or 32-bit floating-point numbers.",
        "You can specify one of the following types:",
        "INT",
        "FLOAT",
        "dimension is the dimension (length) of the vector. This must be a positive integer value with a maximum value of 4096.",

        "Direct vector comparisons (for example, v1 < v2) are byte-wise lexicographic and, while deterministic, won\u2019t produce results\nthat you\u2019d expect from number comparisons. So while you can use VECTOR columns in ORDER BY clauses, for vector comparisons, use the\nvector similarity functions provided.",
