        "Preview Feature \u2014 Open",
        "Available to all non-government accounts that are Enterprise Edition (or higher).",
        "To inquire about upgrading, please contact Snowflake Support.",
        "An organization account is a special type of account that organization administrators use to perform tasks that affect the entire\norganization. For example, administrators use the organization account to do the following:",
        "View organization-level data collected from all accounts in the organization, including the query history from each account.",
        "Enable Snowflake Marketplace terms for the entire organization.",
        "Manage the lifecycle of accounts in an organization, including creating and deleting accounts.",
        "Enable replication for an account.",
        "Before this preview, administrators needed to perform these organization-level tasks using an account that had the\nORGADMIN role enabled. These ORGADMIN-enabled accounts are different from the\norganization account. Unlike the classic approach where an organization might have multiple ORGADMIN-enabled accounts, there is only one\norganization account.",
        "During the preview of organization accounts, organization administrators can still use an\nORGADMIN-enabled account to manage the lifecycle of accounts (for example, creating and\ndeleting accounts). After organization accounts become generally available, there will be a transition period, after which administrators\nwill use the organization account for all organization-level tasks.",
        "Note",
        "Though, in most cases, there are not any limitations on what actions can be performed in an organization account, it is intended to be\nused primarily for organization-level tasks, and not for analytics or other workloads.",
        "Organization administrators use the GLOBALORGADMIN role in the organization account to perform all organization-level tasks, including\nadministration of the organization account itself. The GLOBALORGADMIN role has all of the privileges of the ORGADMIN role along with the\nprivileges that are associated with the ACCOUNTADMIN role in a regular account.",
        "The GLOBALORGADMIN role can assign privileges to other roles to let other users perform organization-level tasks. In the organization\naccount, the GLOBALORGADMIN role can assign the following privileges:",
        "APPLY TAG",
        "MANAGE ACCOUNTS",
        "MANAGE LISTING AUTO FULFILLMENT",
        "MANAGE ORGANIZATION CONTACTS",
        "MANAGE ORGANIZATION TERMS",
        "PURCHASE DATA EXCHANGE LISTING",
        "These privileges are set on the account level. For example, to assign the MANAGE ACCOUNTS privilege to the role custom_role, execute the\nfollowing:",
        "For more information about these privileges, see Access control privileges.",
        "Note",
        "Creating the organization account results in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema being populated with data, which\nincurs additional costs for your organization.",
        "To create the organization account:",
        "Choose an existing account from which you will create the organization account. This existing account must have the\nORGADMIN role enabled.",
        "Sign in to the account you are using to create the organization account.",
        "Switch to the ORGADMIN role. For example:",
        "Execute the CREATE ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT command. For example:",
        "Note",
        "Snowflake does not support custom account locators for organization accounts. For alternatives, contact your Snowflake representative.",
        "If you need to delete the organization account, contact Snowflake Support.",
        "You can move an organization account between regions as long as those regions are in either the PUBLIC region group or a VPS region group.",
        "Snowflake uses replication groups to move objects from the organization account in the source region to the organization account in the new\nregion. As a result, only objects that can be replicated are moved with the organization account. For a list of objects that can be moved\nwith the organization account, see Replicated objects.",
        "Moving the organization account to a different region is a two-step process:",
        "Call the SYSTEM$INITIATE_MOVE_ORGANIZATION_ACCOUNT function from the organization account to start\nthe process of moving it. Snowflake begins replicating objects to the new region.",
        "The function accepts a temporary account name, the new region, and a list of objects to move as its arguments. For example:",
        "When you have verified that the data in the organization account has been successfully replicated in the new region, call the\nSYSTEM$COMMIT_MOVE_ORGANIZATION_ACCOUNT function to finalize the move, specifying a grace period\nafter which the original organization account is deleted.",
        "For example, the following call finalizes the move, and specifies that the original organization account in the source region will\nbe deleted after 14 days.",
        "At any point, you can view the status of an attempt to move an organization account by calling the\nSYSTEM$SHOW_MOVE_ORGANIZATION_ACCOUNT_STATUS function.",
        "Note",
        "When an organization account is moved, the views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema must be repopulated with data, a process that can take up\nto one week.",
        "Like regular accounts, the organization account has an ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema in the shared SNOWFLAKE database that contains usage data.",
        "Most views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema correspond to a view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. For example, the ALERT_HISTORY\nview in both schemas contains data about alerts. The view in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema consolidates data from the corresponding\naccount-level view of each account, allowing you to query usage data for all accounts from one view.",
        "The ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema in an organization account contains more views than the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema in a regular account, which\nallows you to gain additional insights into aggregated account usage across accounts. For example, the organization account allows you to\nuse a single view to track access history across the organization, something you cannot do in a regular account. These additional views are\nconsidered premium views, and incur additional costs.",
        "Note",
        "It can take two weeks from the time an organization account was created until the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema is fully populated with\nhistorical data from accounts.",
        "By default, only users who have been granted the GLOBALORGADMIN role can access the views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema of an organization\naccount. To grant access to other users, the organization administrator can grant the appropriate application role to an account role or user.\nIn an organization account, privileges to views are granted using application roles, not database roles.",
        "Users who have been granted the ORG_USAGE_ADMIN application role can access all views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema of the organization\naccount. The following example lets user joe access all views in the schema:",
        "The organization administrator can also grant access on a more granular level. For example, the ORGANIZATION_OBJECT_VIEWER application role\ngrants access to the DATABASES view, but does not grant access to the TASK_HISTORY view. For a list of the application role required to\naccess a specific view, see ORGANIZATION_USAGE Views.",
        "The premium views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema of the organization account (that is, views that don\u2019t exist in regular accounts) incur\nthe following costs:",
        "Compute costs associated with the serverless tasks that populate the views.",
        "Storage costs associated with storing the data in the views.",
        "Note",
        "If you want to avoid these costs by removing data from the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema, contact Snowflake Support.",
        "You can use the following queries to return the historical costs associated with the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema in the organization account.",
        "If you have access to the USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY view in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema, you can execute the following query to determine\nthe cost of populating the views. You must execute the query in the organization account.",
        "If you have access to the TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema, you can execute the following query to determine the\napproximate amount of storage in TBs. You must execute the query in the organization account.",
        "Snowflake uses the hidden schema snowflake.organization_usage_local to store internal objects used in conjunction with the\nORGANIZATION_USAGE schema (for example, tables, procedures, and tasks). These objects might be visible in the ACCOUNT_USAGE views in the\norganization account. Because these objects are internal, they might change without notice in the future.",
        "The only differences between a new view in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema and the corresponding view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema are\nthe following:",
        "The addition of a few columns.",
        "The latency of the view.",
        "Whether older data is removed from the view.",
        "The majority of the columns in ORGANIZATION_USAGE views are identical to the columns in the corresponding ACCOUNT_USAGE views. The\nfollowing columns have been added to the organization-level views:",

        "It might take up to 24 hours for a view in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema to be updated. This might differ from the latency of the\ncorresponding view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema.",
        "Unlike account-level views, the organization-level views continue to add new data without replacing older data. For example, the\nACCOUNT_USAGE.ALERT_HISTORY view never contains data older than 365 days whereas the ORGANIZATION_USAGE.ALERT_HISTORY continues to add\ndata without removing older data, so it can contain data that is older than 365 days.",
        "The ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema in the organization account contains the following views.",
