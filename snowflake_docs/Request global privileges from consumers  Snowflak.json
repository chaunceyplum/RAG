        "This topic describes how providers can configure a Snowflake Native App to request global\nprivileges from a consumer after the consumer installs the app. These privileges allow\nthe Snowflake Native App to perform tasks in the consumer account, for example creating a warehouse or\na database.",
        "If an app needs to perform actions or create objects outside the context of the Snowflake Native App,\nthe consumer must grant the privileges to allow the application to do so.",

        "Refer to Create a user interface to request privileges and references for information on creating a user interface that\nallows consumers to grant privileges using Snowsight.",
        "To configure a Snowflake Native App to request global privileges providers use the following workflow:",
        "Determine the privileges required by the app.",
        "For example, if an app needs to create a database in the consumer account, the provider  must\nrequest that the consumer grant the CREATE DATABASE global privilege to the application.",
        "Refer to Privileges the provider can request from the consumer for details on the global privileges\nan app can request.",
        "Add the required privileges to the manifest.yml file. See Add a privilege request to the manifest file\nfor details.",

        "A provider can add any of the supported privileges\nin the same manner.",
        "When a provider specifies a privilege in the manifest.yml file, the privilege requests are\nincluded as part of the installed Snowflake Native App. The consumer can view the privilege requests\nafter installing the app.",
        "To view the global privileges required by an app, run the SHOW PRIVILEGES\ncommand as shown in the following example:",
        "After determining the privileges required by a Snowflake Native App, the consumer must then grant\nthese privileges to the app.",
        "To grant the global privilege request in the example above, the consumer runs the\nGRANT <privileges> command as shown in the following example:",
