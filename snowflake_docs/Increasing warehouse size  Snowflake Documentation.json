        "This topic discusses how a warehouse owner or administrator can adjust the size of a warehouse to improve the performance of queries\nrunning on it.",
        "The larger a warehouse, the more compute resources are available to execute a query or set of queries. This makes increasing the size of a\nwarehouse a straightforward strategy for improving query performance; simply upsize the warehouse, re-run the query, and if the increased\nperformance does not justify the increased cost of running the query, return the warehouse to its original size.",
        "Using a larger warehouse has the biggest impact on larger, more complex queries, and may not improve the performance of small, basic\nqueries.",
        "Note",
        "You must have access to the shared SNOWFLAKE database to execute the diagnostic queries provided in this topic. By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role has the privileges needed to execute the queries.",
        "Examining the load of a warehouse can help determine whether increasing its size can help improve performance. If a warehouse is heavily\nloaded, concurrent queries might be competing for its compute resources, in which case increasing the size of a warehouse might not\nprovide as big of a performance boost as expected. But if you can determine that the load is low, there is a good chance that increasing\nthe size of the warehouse will improve the performance of a complex query.",
        "Query: Warehouse Load",
        "This query provides insight into the total load of a warehouse for executed and queued queries. These load values represent the ratio of the total execution time (in seconds) of all queries in a specific state in an interval by the total time (in seconds) for that interval.",
        "For example, if 276 seconds was the total time for 4 queries in a 5 minute (300 second) interval, then the query load value is 276 / 300 = 0.92.",

        "If a query takes less time to execute on a larger warehouse, the increased cost of running a large warehouse might be offset by the reduced\nexecution time. For example, if a query runs twice as fast on the next largest warehouse, the total cost of running the query remains the\nsame.",
        "Tip",
        "Best practice is to limit who can adjust the size of a warehouse. Allowing users to increase the size of a warehouse to meet the needs\nof an individual query can result in unexpected costs if they forget to return the warehouse to its original size once the query has\nbeen executed.",
