        "The behavior of the SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST function is as follows:",
        "Occasionally, the socket connection between the client that calls the function and Snowflake results in a state that Snowflake cannot\nresolve. In these cases, Snowflake returns the function results and includes an empty list for the OCSP values.",
        "When Snowflake cannot resolve the socket connection, the query that calls either allowlist function fails with one of the following error\nmessages:",
        "SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST: Fail to get SSL context",

        "SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST: Peer unverified",
        "SYSTEM$ALLOWLIST: Connection failure",
