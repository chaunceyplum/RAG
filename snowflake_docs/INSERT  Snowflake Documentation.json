        "Replaces a substring of the specified length, starting at the specified\nposition, with a new string or binary value.",
        "This function should not be confused with the INSERT DML command.",
        "The string or BINARY expression for which you want to insert/replace\ncharacters.",
        "The offset at which to start inserting characters. This is 1-based,\nnot 0-based. In other words, the first character in the string is\nconsidered to be at position 1, not position 0. For example, to insert\nat the beginning of the string, set pos to 1.",
        "Valid values are between 1 and one more than the length of the string\n(inclusive).",
        "Setting pos to one more than the length of the string\nmakes the operation equivalent to an append. (This also requires that the\nlen parameter be 0 because you should not try to delete any\ncharacters past the last character.)",
        "The number of characters (starting at pos) that you want\nto replace. Valid values range from 0 to the number of characters between\npos and the end of the string. If this is 0, it means add the\nnew characters without deleting any existing characters.",
        "The string to insert into the base_expr. If this string\nis empty, and if len is greater than zero, then effectively the\noperation becomes a delete (some characters are deleted, and none are added).",
        "The base_expr and insert_expr should be the same data\ntype; either both should be string (e.g. VARCHAR) or both should be binary.",
        "If any of the arguments are NULL, the returned value is NULL.",
        "Returns a string or BINARY that is equivalent to making a copy of\nbase_expr, deleting len characters starting at\npos, and then inserting insert_expr at pos.",
        "Note that the original input base_expr is not changed; the function\nreturns a separate (modified) copy.",
        "This is a simple example:",
        "This example shows that the length of the replacement string can be different\nfrom the length of the substring being replaced:",
        "This shows what happens when the replacement string is empty (the function deletes the\nspecified number of characters starting at the start position, and does not\nadd any characters):",
        "This uses INSERT as an append operation, by adding characters immediately\nafter the last character in the original string:",
        "The following all return NULL because at least one of the arguments is NULL:",
