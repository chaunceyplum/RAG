        "Removes files from either an external (external cloud storage) or internal (i.e. Snowflake) stage.",
        "For internal stages, the following stage types are supported:",

        "namespace is the database and/or schema in which the named internal stage or table resides. It is optional if a\ndatabase and schema are currently in use within the session; otherwise, it is required.",
        "path is an optional case-sensitive path for files in the cloud storage location (i.e. files have names that begin with a\ncommon string) that limits access to a set of files. Paths are alternatively called prefixes or folders by different cloud\nstorage services.",
        "Note",
        "If the stage name or path includes spaces or special characters, it must be enclosed in single quotes (e.g. '@\"my stage\"'\nfor a stage named \"my stage\").",
        "Specifies a regular expression pattern for filtering files to remove. The command lists all files in the specified path\nand applies the regular expression pattern on each of the files found.",
        "If you are loading data from a file on a stage, do not remove the staged files until the data has been loaded successfully. To check if the data has been loaded successfully, use the COPY_HISTORY command. Check the STATUS column to determine if the data from the file has been loaded. Note that if the status is Load in progress, removing the staged file can result in partial loads and data loss.",
        "Removing files from an external stage requires granting the following role or permission to Snowflake in your cloud storage account:",

        "To remove all files for a specific directory, include a forward-slash (/) at the end of the path. For example:",
        "Do not remove the worksheet_data directory in the Snowflake user stage. The Classic Console stores metadata\nfor worksheets in the Worksheets  tab in this directory. Removing the directory removes access to the\nworksheets, which cannot be restored.",
        "This precaution does not apply to worksheets in Snowsight,\nwhich are stored elsewhere and are not prone to accidental deletion.",
