        "Note that this function uses multiset semantics, which means that the maximum number\nof occurrences of an individual value in a single input ARRAY determines the number of occurrences of that value in the output\nARRAY. See Examples.",
        "The function ignores NULL values in column and in the ARRAYs in column. If column contains only\nNULL values or the table containing column is empty, the function returns an empty ARRAY.",
