        "For example: COMPANY.SFC_SAMPLES.SAMPLE_DATA.",
        "The output from the commands includes the column, OWNER_ACCOUNT, that contains the account identifier\nfor the account that owns the share, and the NAME column only shows the share name.",
        "For example, OWNER_ACCOUNT contains COMPANY.SFC_SAMPLES and NAME contains SAMPLE_DATA.",
        "The OWNER_ACCOUNT column is added before the NAME column in the output.",
