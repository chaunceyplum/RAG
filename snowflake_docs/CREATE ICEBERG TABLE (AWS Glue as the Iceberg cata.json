    "paragraphs": [
        "Creates or replaces an Apache Iceberg\u2122 table in the current/specified schema using\nan Iceberg table that is registered in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.\nThis type of Iceberg table requires a catalog integration\nto connect Snowflake to AWS Glue.",
        "This topic refers to Iceberg tables as simply \u201ctables\u201d except where specifying Iceberg tables avoids confusion.",
        "Note",
        "Before creating a table, you must create the external volume where the Iceberg metadata\nand data files are stored.\nFor instructions, see Configure an external volume.",
        "You also need a catalog integration for the table.\nTo learn more, see Configure a catalog integration for AWS Glue.",
        "ALTER ICEBERG TABLE , DROP ICEBERG TABLE , SHOW ICEBERG TABLES , DESCRIBE ICEBERG TABLE , UNDROP ICEBERG TABLE",
        "Specifies the identifier (name) for the table; must be unique for the schema in which the table is created.",
        "In addition, the identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the\nentire identifier string is enclosed in double quotes (for example, \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also\ncase-sensitive.",
        "For more information, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Specifies the table name as recognized by the AWS Glue Data Catalog. For an example of using\nCATALOG_TABLE_NAME when you create an Iceberg table,\nsee Examples (in this topic).",
        "This parameter cannot be changed after you create the table.",
        "Specifies the identifier (name) for the external volume where the Iceberg table stores its metadata files and data in Parquet\nformat. Iceberg metadata and manifest files store the table schema, partitions, snapshots, and other metadata.",
        "If you don\u2019t specify this parameter, the Iceberg table defaults to the external volume for the schema, database, or account.\nThe schema takes precedence over the database, and the database takes precedence over the account.",
        "Specifies the identifier (name) of the catalog integration for this table.\nYou must specify a catalog integration that you have configured for AWS Glue. For information,\nsee Configure a catalog integration for AWS Glue.",
        "If not specified, the Iceberg table defaults to the catalog integration for the schema, database, or account.\nThe schema takes precedence over the database, and the database takes precedence over the account.",
        "Optionally specifies the namespace (for example, my_glue_database) for the AWS Glue Data Catalog source,\nand overrides the default catalog namespace specified with the catalog integration. By specifying a namespace at the table level,\nyou can use a single catalog integration for AWS Glue to create Iceberg tables across different databases.",
        "If not specified, the table uses the default catalog namespace associated with the catalog integration.",
        "Specifies whether to replace invalid UTF-8 characters with the Unicode replacement character (\ufffd) in query results.\nYou can only set this parameter for tables that use an external Iceberg catalog.",
        "TRUE replaces invalid UTF-8 characters with the Unicode replacement character.",
        "FALSE leaves invalid UTF-8 characters unchanged. Snowflake returns a user error message when it encounters invalid UTF-8\ncharacters in a Parquet data file.",
        "If not specified, the Iceberg table defaults to the parameter value for the schema, database, or account.\nThe schema takes precedence over the database, and the database takes precedence over the account.",
        "Default: FALSE",
        "Specifies whether Snowflake should automatically poll the external Iceberg catalog associated with the table for metadata updates\nwhen you use automated refresh.\nIf no value is specified for the REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS parameter on the catalog integration, Snowflake uses a default\nrefresh interval of 30 seconds.",
        "Default: FALSE",
        "Preview feature",
        "Available to all accounts.",
        "Specifies a comment for the table.",
        "Default: No value",
        "Specifies the tag name and the tag string value.",
        "The tag value is always a string, and the maximum number of characters for the tag value is 256.",
        "For information about specifying tags in a statement, see Tag quotas for objects and columns.",

        "Considerations for running this command:",
        "If you created your external volume or catalog integration using a double-quoted identifier,\nyou must specify the identifier exactly as created (including the double quotes) in your CREATE ICEBERG TABLE statement.\nFailure to include the quotes might result in an Object does not exist error (or\nsimilar type of error).",
        "To view an example, see the Examples (in this topic) section.",
        "Considerations for creating tables:",
        "A schema cannot contain tables and/or views with the same name. When creating a table:",
        "If a view with the same name already exists in the schema, an error is returned and the table is not created.",
        "If a table with the same name already exists in the schema, an error is returned and the table is not created, unless the optional\nOR REPLACE keyword is included in the command.",
        "CREATE OR REPLACE <object> statements are atomic. That is, when an object is replaced, the old object is deleted and the new object is created in a single transaction.",
        "This means that any queries concurrent with the CREATE OR REPLACE ICEBERG TABLE operation use either the old or new table version.",
        "Similar to reserved keywords, ANSI-reserved function names\n(CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, etc.) cannot be used as column names.",
        "Recreating a table (using the optional OR REPLACE keyword) drops its history, which makes any stream on the table stale. A stale\nstream is unreadable.",
        "Regarding metadata:",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
        "This example creates an Iceberg table that uses the AWS Glue Data Catalog. To override the default catalog namespace and set a\ncatalog namespace for the table, the statement uses the optional CATALOG_NAMESPACE parameter.",
        "This example creates an Iceberg table with an external volume and catalog integration\nwhose identifiers contain double quotes. Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are case-sensitive and often contain special characters.",
        "The identifiers \"glue_volume_1\" and \"glue_catalog_integration_1\" are specified exactly as created (including the double quotes).\nFailure to include the quotes might result in an Object does not exist error (or similar type of error).",
