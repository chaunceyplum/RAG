        "The session context of a notebook is defined by the role, warehouse, database, and schema that you defined when you created the notebook.\nWhen you run the notebook, it runs as that role, using the warehouse defined in the notebook, and in the context of the database and schema\nthat contain the notebook.",
        "This topic describes how to access or change the session context of your notebook.",
        "You can access the session context using both Python and SQL.",
        "If you\u2019re using the Snowpark Python library or Snowflake Python APIs, use the\nget_active_session()\nmethod to get the active session context.",
        "For SQL, you can use the Context functions SQL functions.",
        "You can change the session context of the notebook to use a different role, database and schema, and/or warehouse:",

        "If you change your role to one that does not have privileges to use the notebook warehouse, database, or schema,\nqueries that require a warehouse or access to the notebook database or schema fail to run. However,\nyou can still run queries that do not use the notebook warehouse, database, and schema.",
        "Roles specified with the USE ROLE SQL command do not persist across notebook sessions.",
        "If you specify a database or schema that the currently active role does not have privileges to access, queries using that database\nand schema fail to run.",
