        "Snowflake CLI automatically validates a Snowflake Native App setup script, along with any other SQL files included using the SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement, when you run (snow app run) or deploy (snow app deploy) an application. It uses the script most recently uploaded by one of the commands. Validation checks for SQL syntax errors, invalid object references, and best practices. If the script validation fails, the executed command aborts but does not automatically roll back the staged files.",

        "Occasionally, you might want to validate a setup script before deploying an application to avoid potential impacts that could occur if validation fails during the deployment process. The snow app validate command validates a setup script without needing to run or deploy an application. It uploads source files to a separate scratch stage that drops automatically after the command completes to avoid disturbing files in the application\u2019s source stage.",
