        "You can use worksheets to write and run SQL commands on your database. Your trial\naccount has access to a template worksheet for this tutorial. The worksheet has the SQL\ncommands that you will run to create database objects, load data, and query the\ndata. Because it is a template worksheet, you will be invited to enter your own values\nfor certain SQL parameters. For more information about worksheets,\nsee Getting started with worksheets.",
        "The worksheet for this tutorial is not pre-loaded into the trial account. To open\nthe worksheet for this tutorial:",

        "A warehouse provides the required resources to create and manage objects and run\nSQL commands. These resources include CPU, memory, and temporary storage. Your\ntrial account has a virtual warehouse (compute_wh) that you can use for this\ntutorial. For more information, see Virtual warehouses.",
        "To set the role and warehouse to use, do the following:",

        "Place your cursor in the USE WAREHOUSE line, then select Run.",
        "A database is a repository for your data. The data is stored in tables that you can\nmanage and query. A schema is a logical grouping of database objects, such as tables\nand views. For example, a schema might contain the database objects required for a\nspecific application. For more information, see Databases, Tables and Views - Overview.",
        "To create a database, a schema, and a table, do the following:",

        "Before you can load data from cloud storage, you must configure a storage integration that is\nspecific to your cloud provider. The following example is specific to GCS.",
        "Storage integrations are named, first-class Snowflake objects that avoid the need for passing explicit cloud\nprovider credentials such as secret keys or access tokens; instead, integration objects reference\na GCS service account.",
        "To create a storage integration for GCS, do the following:",
        "In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the CREATE OR REPLACE STORAGE INTEGRATION lines, define\nthe required parameters, and select Run. For example:",
        "Place your cursor in the DESCRIBE INTEGRATION line, specify the name of the storage\nintegration you created, and select Run. This command returns information about the\nstorage integration you created, including the Service Account ID (STORAGE_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT) that was\ncreated automatically for your Snowflake account. You will use this value to configure permissions for\nSnowflake in the GCS Console.",

        "You need the required permissions to create and manage objects in your account. In this tutorial,\nyou use the ACCOUNTADMIN system role for these privileges.",
        "This role is not normally used to create objects. Instead, we recommend creating a hierarchy of\nroles aligned with business functions in your organization. For more information, see\nUsing the ACCOUNTADMIN Role.",
        "You need a warehouse for the resources required to create and manage objects and run SQL commands.\nThis tutorial uses the compute_wh warehouse included with your trial account.",
        "You created a database to store the data and a schema to group the database objects logically.",
        "You created a storage integration and a stage to load data from a CSV file stored in a GCS bucket.",
