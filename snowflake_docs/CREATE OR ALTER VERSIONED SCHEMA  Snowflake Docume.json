        "Specifies the identifier for the schema; must be unique for the application instance in which the schema is created.",
        "In addition, the identifier must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire\nidentifier string is enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \"My object\"). Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also\ncase-sensitive.",

        "In managed schemas, the schema owner manages all privilege grants, including\nfuture grants, on objects in the schema.\nObject owners retain the OWNERSHIP privileges on the objects, however, only the schema owner can\nmanage privilege grants on the objects.",
        "Specifies the number of days for which Time Travel actions (CLONE and UNDROP) can be performed on the schema, as well as specifying the\ndefault Time Travel retention time for all tables created in the schema. For more details, refer\nUnderstanding & using Time Travel.",

        "For a detailed description of this parameter, see MAX_DATA_EXTENSION_TIME_IN_DAYS.",
        "Specifies a default collation specification for all tables added to the schema. The default\ncan be overridden at the individual table level.",
