        "Aggregate functions operate on values across rows to perform mathematical calculations such as sum, average, counting, minimum/maximum values, standard\ndeviation, and estimation, as well as some non-mathematical operations.",
        "An aggregate function takes multiple rows (actually, zero, one, or more rows) as input and produces a single output.\nIn contrast, scalar functions take one row as input and produce one row (one value) as output.",
        "An aggregate function always returns exactly one row, even when the input contains zero rows. Typically, if\nthe input contains zero rows, the output is NULL. However, an aggregate function could return 0, an empty string, or\nsome other value when passed zero rows.",

        "If SUM is called with an expression that references two or more columns, and if one or more of those columns\nis NULL, then the expression evaluates to NULL, and the row is ignored:",
