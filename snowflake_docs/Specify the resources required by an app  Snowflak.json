        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "This topic describes how to use the marketplace.yml file to declare the resource\nrequirements for an Snowflake Native App.",
        "The marketplace.yml is a configuration file similar to the manifest.yml\nfile of an app. Snowflake uses this file in the following contexts:",
        "The objects specified in required_compute_pools and connections properties\nappear in the listing in Snowsight. This give the consumer to see the resources the app\nmay require.",
        "This file can help avoid creating or using unnecessary resources, for example replicating an application\npackage to a regions where it cannot be installed by a consumer. Before consumer requests the listing in a\nremote region, Snowflake ensures that the consumer meets the resource requirements declared in the\nmarketplace.yml file. This helps prevent unnecessary replication costs.",
        "Before installing and upgrading the application, Snowsight ensures the requirements are satisfied,\nto prevent installing a broken/unusable application or upgrading a working application into a unusable state.",
        "This optional file must be at the root directory of an app at the same level as the manifest.yml\nfile. If this file is not present, no action is taken.",
        "The following example shows how to specify the compute pool resources required for a\nspecific version of an app:",
        "In this example, the required_compute_pools a compute pool named HIGH_MEM_POOL_1.",
        "The compatible_instance_families property specifies the type of machine to provision\nfor the compute pool. You must specify at least one value declared for each compute pool.\nSee CREATE COMPUTE POOL for more information.",
        "Note",
        "If the compatible_instance_families property is missing or the values are invalid,\nversion creation fails.",
        "The following example shows how to declare the external endpoints required by an app:",
        "In this example, the connection property specifies two external endpoints,\nLAUNCH_DARKLY and OPEN_AI. The required property indicates to the\nconsumer in Snowsight that the connection is required.",
        "If you specify the connection in this file, the endpoints, and required properties are\nrequired. If these properties are not present, version creation fails. The endpoints property\nrequires at least one URL.",
