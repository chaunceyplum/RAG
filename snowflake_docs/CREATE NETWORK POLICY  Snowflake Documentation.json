        "Creates a network policy or replaces an existing network policy.",
        "Note",
        "Only security administrators (i.e. users with the SECURITYADMIN role) or higher or a role with the global CREATE NETWORK POLICY\nprivilege can create network policies.",

        "ALTER ACCOUNT",
        "Identifier for the network policy; must be unique for your account.",
        "The identifier value must start with an alphabetic character and cannot contain spaces or special characters unless the entire identifier\nstring is enclosed in double quotes (e.g. \"My object\"), Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "For more details, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Specifies a list of network rules that contain the network identifiers that are allowed access to\nSnowflake. There is no limit on the number of network rules in the list.",
        "Specifies a list of network rules that contain the network identifiers that are denied access to Snowflake. There is no limit on the\nnumber of network rules in the list.",
        "Specifies a list of IPv4 addresses that are allowed access to your Snowflake account. This is referred to as the allowed list.",
        "Snowflake recommends using network rules in conjunction with network policies rather than using this property. Use the\nALLOWED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST property to specify network rules that contain IPv4 addresses.",
        "If you are not yet using network rules, specify at least one IPv4 address or CIDR block range to allow access to your Snowflake\naccount. Additionally, if you are not using network rules and this property is specified with an empty list, no IPv4 addresses are\nallowed to access your Snowflake account.",
        "Specifies a list of IPv4 addresses that are denied access to your Snowflake account. This is referred to as the blocked list.\nTo unset this parameter, specify a different CIDR block range, a series of IPv4 addresses, or a single IPv4 address.",
        "Snowflake recommends using network rules in conjunction with network policies rather than using this parameter. Use the\nBLOCKED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST property to specify network rules that contain IPv4 addresses.",
        "To block public access, use a network rule and add the network rule to the BLOCKED_NETWORK_RULE_LIST property. The result is\nthat only IP addresses that use private connectivity, such as AWS PrivateLink, can access your Snowflake account.",
        "Default: No value; no IP addresses in ALLOWED_IP_LIST property are blocked.",
        "Specifies a comment for the network policy.",
        "Default: No value",

        "Account",
        "Only the SECURITYADMIN role, or a higher role, has this privilege by default. The privilege can be granted to additional roles as needed.",
        "For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see Creating custom roles.",
        "For general information about roles and privilege grants for performing SQL actions on\nsecurable objects, see Overview of Access Control.",
        "Use network rules in conjunction with the network policy to manage access to your Snowflake account.",
        "You cannot execute a CREATE OR REPLACE NETWORK POLICY command to replace an existing network policy if that policy is currently assigned\nto an account, security integration, or user.",
        "Each ip_address can cover a range of addresses using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation:",
        "ip_address[/optional_prefix_length]",
        "For example:",
        "192.168.1.0/24",
        "When a network policy includes values for both ALLOWED_IP_LIST and BLOCKED_IP_LIST, Snowflake applies the\nblocked list first.",
        "The maximum number of characters for the ALLOWED_IP_LIST list is 100,000. Snowflake returns an error message when this\ncharacter limit is exceeded.",
        "After creating a network policy, you must associate it with your account before Snowflake enforces the policy. You can associate a\npolicy with your account through the ALTER ACCOUNT command, which must be run by a user with the SECURITYADMIN\nrole (or higher).",
        "For example:",
        "For more details, see Parameter management. Note that NETWORK_POLICY is currently the only account\nparameter that can be set by users with the SECURITYADMIN role.",
        "Before associating a network policy with your account, your current IP address must be included in ALLOWED_IP_LIST; otherwise,\nthe ALTER ACCOUNT command returns an error. In addition, your current IP address cannot be included in BLOCKED_IP_LIST.",
        "Regarding metadata:",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
        "CREATE OR REPLACE <object> statements are atomic. That is, when an object is replaced, the old object is deleted and the new object is created in a single transaction.",
        "Create a network policy named allow_vpceid_block_public_policy based on two network rules, one that allows a VPCE ID and one that blocks public network traffic, as described in Interaction between allowed lists and blocked lists.",
