        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "This topic describes how to add versions and patches to an application package.",
        "For general information about versions and patches and how they are used to update and\nupgrade an app, see About app versions and patches.",
        "The version and patches of an app are defined in the application package.",
        "After adding a version or patch to an application package, providers can test the changes locally\nby creating an application object based on the version or patch.",
        "See Create an application object from a version or patch level for more information.",
        "To specify a version or patch for an application package, you must have one of the following privileges\ngranted on the application package to your role:",
        "OWNERSHIP",
        "MANAGE VERSIONS",
        "For example, to grant the MANAGE VERSION privilege on the application package to the\nrelease_mgr role, use the GRANT <privileges> command as shown in the following\nexample:",
        "To add a version to the application package by using SQL, run the ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE\ncommand:",
        "In this example, v1 is an identifier for the version. This identifier is not visible to consumers when they install\nthe application. The consumer sees version information as defined in the LABEL clause.",
        "Caution",
        "Only two versions of an application can exist at the same time. See About app versions and patches\nfor more information.",
        "You can define the version name and label in the manifest.yml file, or specify them directly with the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command. If you define them in the manifest.yml file as well as with the SQL\ncommand, the values specified in the SQL command take precedence over the values specified in the manifest.yml\nfile.",
        "In addition to creating versions for an app you can also create patches for a specific version. Like\nversions, app patches also have their own application files.",
        "To create a new patch for an application package, use the ADD PATCH FOR VERSION clause of the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE \u2026 VERSION command, as shown in the following\nexample:",
        "In the example, no patch number is provided to the ADD PATCH FOR VERSION V1_0 clause. In this case\nSnowflake automatically increments the patch number by 1.",
        "To create a new patch for an application with a custom patch number, provide a patch number to the\nADD PATCH FOR VERSION clause of the ALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE \u2026 VERSION\ncommand, as shown in the following example:",
        "As a provider, you can view the versions and patches defined for an application by running the\nSHOW VERSIONS command on the application package.",
        "The following command displays the versions and patches that have been defined for an application\npackage named hello_snowflake_package:",
        "To remove a version from an application package, you must verify that there are no\nrelease directives currently\npointing that the version you want to remove.",
        "See View the release directives for an application package for information on viewing the release directives.",
        "To remove a version from an application package, use the DROP VERSION clause of the\nALTER APPLICATION PACKAGE command as shown in the following example:",
        "After running this command, the version is not dropped until all installed instances of the app are dropped.\nTo verify the status of the drop command, use the SHOW VERSIONS as shown in\nthe following example:",
        "The dropped_on column lists the timestamp when the drop was initiated.",
        "Note",
        "The dropped version only appears in the output of this command while the status is DROPPED.\nWhen all installed instances of the app are dropped, the dropped version no longer appears.",
        "When a version is dropped, consumers can no longer install new instances of that version of the app.",
        "Depending on how the application is published to consumers, it can take different amounts of time\nfor the version to be dropped:",
        "If the application package has not been published to consumers, the version is dropped immediately.",
        "If the application package has been published as a public or private listing within a single region,\nthe version is dropped immediately.",
        "If the application package is published as the data product of a listing shared within the same\nregion as the application package, the version is dropped within a few hours.",
        "If the application package is published as the data product of a listing using\nCross-Cloud Auto-Fulfillment,\nit may take longer for the version to be dropped across all regions.",
