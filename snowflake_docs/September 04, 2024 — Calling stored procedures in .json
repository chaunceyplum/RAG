        "You can now call a stored procedure that returns tabular data directly in the FROM clause\nof a SELECT statement. You can use this technique to simplify the SQL statements for saving\nresults to a table. For example, rather than using the\nSQLID Snowflake Scripting variable with the\nRESULT_SCAN function to create a table containing these results,\nyou can use a query that directly selects from the results.",
        "When calling the stored procedure, omit the CALL command. Instead, put the call\nin parentheses, preceded by the TABLE keyword.",
