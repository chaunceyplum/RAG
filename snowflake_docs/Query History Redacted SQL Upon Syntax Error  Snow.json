        "This implementation is done mainly for security reasons, where sensitive information like passwords cannot be redacted for queries with\ninvalid syntax (which is done for syntactically valid queries). However, the user who executed the query would still be able to view the\nun-redacted query.",

However, another user (even if they use the same role used for executing the failed query) will not be able\nto see the query text. The entry in the QUERY_HISTORY view is available for everyone\nwho has the necessary privileges to check this view.",
