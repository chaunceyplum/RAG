        "This feature requires Enterprise Edition (or higher). To inquire about upgrading, please contact Snowflake Support.",
        "Search optimization is generally transparent to users. Queries work the same; some are just faster. However, it is\nimportant to be aware of possible effects of other table operations on the search optimization service, or the reverse.",
        "A search access path becomes invalid if the default value of a column is changed.",
        "To use search optimization again after a search access path has become invalid, you must\ndrop the SEARCH OPTIMIZATION property and\nadd the SEARCH OPTIMIZATION property back to the table.",
        "A search access path remains valid if you add, drop, or rename a column:",
        "If you enabled search optimization for an entire table without specifying specific columns, then when you add a column to a table, the\nnew column is added to the search access path automatically. However, if you used the ON clause when enabling search optimization for a\ncolumn, new columns are not added automatically.",
        "When you drop a column from a table, the dropped column is removed from the search access path automatically.",
        "Renaming a column doesn\u2019t require any changes to the search access path.",
        "If you drop a table, the SEARCH OPTIMIZATION property and search access paths are also dropped. Note that:",
        "Undropping the table immediately reestablishes search optimization as a property of the table.",
        "When you drop a table, the search access path has the same data retention period as the table.",
        "If you drop the SEARCH OPTIMIZATION property from the table, the search access\npath is removed. When you\nadd the SEARCH OPTIMIZATION property back to the table,\nthe maintenance service needs to recreate the search access path. (There is no way to undrop the property.)",
        "If you clone a table, schema, or database, the SEARCH OPTIMIZATION property and search access paths of each table are\nalso cloned. Cloning a table, schema, or database creates a zero-copy clone of each table\nand its corresponding search access paths. However, if the search access path for a table is out-of-date at the time the clone\nis created, both the original table and the cloned table incur the maintenance costs for the search optimization service to\nupdate the search access path.",
        "The search access path might be out-of-date if a DML operation significantly modifies a table just before the clone operation. For example,\nif an INSERT statement results in a large increase in the size of the original table, the search access path requires maintenance to\nreflect this change.",
        "To avoid or minimize the costs of search optimization maintenance tasks on the cloned table, follow one or both of these steps:",
        "If you need to leave search optimization enabled on the cloned table, verify that the search access path is up-to-date before\nexecuting the CREATE TABLE \u2026 CLONE statement. Otherwise, skip to the next step.",
        "In most cases, you can execute a SHOW TABLES statement and check the value in the SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_PROGRESS column. If the\ncolumn\u2019s value is 100, the search access path is up-to-date. However, maintenance might be incurred if the search access\npath is being compacted to remove information pertaining to deleted source table data.",
        "Disable the search optimization service on the cloned table immediately after the clone is created. For example, to disable\nthe search optimization service on table t1, execute the following statement:",
        "For more information, see Search optimization actions (searchOptimizationAction) in the ALTER TABLE topic.",
        "If you use CREATE TABLE \u2026 LIKE to create a new empty table with the same columns as the original table,\nthe SEARCH OPTIMIZATION property is not copied to the new table.",
        "If a table in the primary database has the SEARCH OPTIMIZATION property enabled, the property is replicated to the corresponding\ntable in the secondary database.",
        "Search access paths in the secondary database are not replicated but are instead rebuilt automatically. Note that this process\nincurs the same kinds of costs described in Search optimization cost estimation and management.",
        "Data providers can use Secure Data Sharing to share tables that have search optimization\nenabled.",
        "When querying shared tables, data consumers can benefit from any performance improvements made by the search optimization service.",
        "The search optimization service is fully compatible with tables that use masking policies and row access policies.",
        "However, when search optimization is enabled, a user who is prevented from seeing a value due to a masking policy or row\naccess policy might be able to deduce with greater certainty whether that value exists. With or without search\noptimization, differences in query latency can provide hints about the presence or absence of data restricted by a\npolicy, which may constitute a security issue depending on the sensitivity of the data. This effect can be magnified by\nsearch optimization since it can make a query that does not return results even faster.",
        "For example, suppose that a row access policy prevents a user from accessing rows with country = 'US', but the data\ndoes not include rows with country = 'US'. Now suppose that search optimization is enabled for the country column\nand that the user runs a query with WHERE country = 'US'. The query returns empty results as expected, but the query\nmight run faster with search optimization than without. In this case, the user can more easily infer that the data does not\ncontain any rows where country = 'US' based on the time taken to run the query.",
