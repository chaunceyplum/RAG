        "Removes a database from the system.",
        "Tip",
        "In addition to SQL, you can also use other interfaces, such as Snowflake REST APIs, Snowflake Python APIs, and Snowflake CLI.\nSee Alternate interfaces.",
        "CREATE DATABASE , ALTER DATABASE , DESCRIBE DATABASE , SHOW DATABASES , UNDROP DATABASE",
        "Specifies the identifier for the database to drop. If the identifier contains spaces, special characters, or mixed-case characters,\nthe entire string must be enclosed in double quotes. Identifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "Specifies whether the database can be dropped if foreign keys exist that reference any tables in the database:",
        "CASCADE drops the database and all objects in the database, including tables with primary/unique keys that are referenced by\nforeign keys in other tables.",
        "RESTRICT returns a warning about existing foreign key references and does not drop the database.",
        "Default: CASCADE",
        "Dropping a database does not permanently remove it from the system. A version of the dropped database is retained in\nTime Travel for the number of days specified by the DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS parameter\nfor the database:",
        "Within the Time Travel retention period, a dropped database can be restored using the UNDROP DATABASE command.",
        "When the Time Travel retention period ends, the next state for the dropped database depends on whether it is permanent or transient:",
        "A permanent database moves into Fail-safe. In Fail-safe (7 days), a dropped database can be\nrecovered, but only by Snowflake. When the database leaves Fail-safe, it is purged.",
        "A transient database has no Fail-safe, so it is purged when it moves out of Time Travel.",
        "Once a dropped database has been purged, it cannot be recovered; it must be recreated.",
        "Currently, when a database is dropped, the data retention period for child schemas or tables, if explicitly set to be different from the\nretention of the database, is not honored. The child schemas or tables are retained for the same period of time as the database. To honor\nthe data retention period for these child objects (schemas or tables), drop them explicitly before you drop the database or\nschema.",
        "After dropping a database, creating a database with the same name creates a new version of the database. The dropped version of the\nprevious database can still be restored using the following method:",
        "Rename the current version of the database to a different name.",
        "Use the UNDROP DATABASE command to restore the previous version.",
        "If a policy or tag is attached a table or view column, dropping the database successfully requires the policy or tag to be self-contained\nwithin the database and schema. For example, database_1 contains policy_1 and policy_1 is only used in database_1.\nOtherwise, a dangling reference occurs.",
        "The DROP operation fails if a session policy or password policy is set on a user or the account.",
        "You can drop a secondary database at any time. Only the database owner (i.e. the role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the database) can\ndrop the database.",
        "A primary database cannot be dropped if one or more replicas of the database (i.e. secondary databases) exist. To drop the primary\ndatabase, first promote a secondary database to serve as the primary database, and then drop the former primary database. Alternatively,\ndrop all of the secondary databases for the primary database, and then drop the primary database.",
