        "Snowflake Notebooks is a development interface in Snowsight that offers an interactive, cell-based programming environment for Python\nand SQL. In Snowflake Notebooks, you can perform exploratory data analysis, develop machine learning models, and perform other data science and\ndata engineering tasks all in one place. For more information, see About Snowflake Notebooks.",
        "Cell output limits - When viewing cell results for each DataFrame output, only 10,000 rows or 8 MB is displayed, whichever is lower.\nFor each cell, only 20 MB of output is allowed.",
        "Reconnection/idle time setting - Users can configure an idle timeout setting to automatically shut down the notebook session once the\nsetting is met. The default setting is 30 minutes. Notebooks will automatically reconnect if you return to the session before the timeout\nsetting has elapsed. You can change the idle time for each notebook in Snowsight or using the IDLE_AUTO_SHUTDOWN_TIME_SECONDS\nproperty using SQL. For more information, see Develop and run code in Snowflake Notebooks.",
