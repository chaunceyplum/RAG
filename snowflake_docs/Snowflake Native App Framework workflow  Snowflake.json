        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "This topic describes the workflows for developing, publishing, and installing an application created\nusing the Native Apps Framework.",
        "The following workflow outlines the general tasks for developing and testing an application\nusing the Native Apps Framework:",
        "Note",
        "Developing an application is an iterative process. You might perform many of these tasks multiple\ntimes or in a different order depending on the requirements of your application and environment.",
        "Create the setup script for your\napplication.",
        "The setup script contains the SQL statements that define the components created\nwhen a consumer installs your application.",
        "Create the manifest file for your\napplication.",
        "The manifest file defines the configuration and setup properties required by the application,\nincluding the location of the setup script and versions.",
        "Upload the application files to a named stage.",
        "The setup script, the manifest file, and other resources that your application requires\nmust be uploaded to a named stage so that these files are available as you develop your application.",
        "Create an application package.",
        "An application package is a container that encapsulates the data content, application logic,\nmetadata, and setup script required by an application.",
        "Add versions and patch levels to your application.",
        "Adding versions and patches to your application allows you to add features to your application\nor fix problems.",
        "Add shared data content to your application.",
        "The Native Apps Framework allows you to securely share your data content with consumers.",
        "Add application logic.",
        "You can include business logic as part of your application. An application can contain:",
        "User-defined functions (UDFs) and stored procedures.",
        "Snowpark functions and procedures written in Python, Java, and Scala.",
        "External functions.",
        "Set up logging and event handling to troubleshoot your application.",
        "To troubleshoot an application, the Native Apps Framework provides logging and event handling.\nConsumers can set up logging and event handling in their account and share them with providers.",
        "Set the release directive for your application.",
        "A release directive determines which version and patch level are available to consumers.",
        "Test your application.",
        "You can test an application in your account before publishing it to consumers. The Native Apps\nFramework provides development mode and\ndebug mode to test different aspects of your application.",
        "Run the automated security scan.",
        "Before you can share an application with consumers outside your organization, the application must pass an automated\nsecurity scan to ensure that it is secure and stable.",
        "After developing and testing the application, providers can publish the application to share it\nwith consumers. See Sharing an Application with Consumers\nfor details.",
        "Become a provider.",
        "Becoming a provider allows you to create and manage listings to share your application with consumers.",
        "Create a listing.",
        "You can create a private listing or a Snowflake Marketplace listing to share your application with consumers.",
        "Submit your listing for approval.",
        "Before you can publish a listing to the Snowflake Marketplace, you must submit the listing to\nSnowflake for approval.",
        "Publish your listing.",
        "After your listing is approved, you can publish the listing to make it available to consumers.",
        "Consumers can discover the application and install it from a listing. After installing the\napplication, consumers can configure, use, and monitor the application. See\nWorking with Applications as a Consumer.",
        "Become a Snowflake consumer.",
        "Becoming a Snowflake consumer allows you to access listings shared privately or on the\nSnowflake Marketplace. You can also access data shared as part of direct shares or data exchanges, which\noffer more limited data sharing capabilities.",
        "Install the application.",
        "Consumers can install an application from a listing.",
        "Grant the privileges required by the application.",
        "Some applications might ask the consumer to grant global and object-level privileges to\nthe application.",
        "Enable logging and event sharing to troubleshoot the application.",
        "A provider can set up an application to emit logging and event data. A consumer can set up an events table\nto share this data with providers. Logs and event data are useful when troubleshooting an application.",
        "Manage the application.",
        "After installing and configuring the application, a consumer can perform additional tasks to\nuse and monitor the application.",
