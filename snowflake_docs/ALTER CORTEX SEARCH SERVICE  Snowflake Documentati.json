    "paragraphs": [
        "Modifies the properties of an existing Cortex Search service.",
        "Specifies the identifier for the Cortex Search service to alter.",
        "If the identifier contains spaces or special characters, the entire string must be enclosed in double quotes.\nIdentifiers enclosed in double quotes are also case-sensitive.",
        "For more information, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Suspends or resumes the indexing, serving or both for a Cortex Search service. You can specify one of the following keywords to indicate\nwhich layer to suspend or resume:",
        "The target that indicates the indexing layer of the Cortex Search Service. For more details, see Usage Notes.",
        "The target that indicates the serving layer of the Cortex Search Service. For more details, see Usage Notes.",
        "If you do not specify either keyword, both the indexing and serving layers are suspended or resumed.",
        "Sets one or more specified properties or parameters to set for the Cortex Search service:",
        "Specifies the maximum amount of time that the Cortex Search service content should lag behind updates to the base tables specified in the source query.",
        "Specifies the warehouse to use for running the source query, building the search index, and keeping it refreshed per the TARGET_LAG target.",
        "Adds a comment or overwrites an existing comment for the search service.",
        "Privilege",
        "Object",
        "OWNERSHIP",
        "Cortex Search service you want to modify properties on.",
        "The USAGE privilege on the parent database and schema are required to perform operations on any object in a schema.",
        "For instructions on creating a custom role with a specified set of privileges, see Creating custom roles.",
        "For general information about roles and privilege grants for performing SQL actions on\nsecurable objects, see Overview of Access Control.",
        "Attention",
        "Customers should ensure that no personal data (other than for a User object), sensitive data, export-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered as metadata when using the Snowflake service. For more information, see Metadata fields in Snowflake.",
        "INDEXING is the target that indicates the indexing layer of the Cortex Search Service. When in the RUNNING state, changes in base tables\nreferenced by the service\u2019s source query will prompt refreshes of the materialized data stored as part of the search index. These\nrefreshes incur cost in the form of warehouse compute and vector embeddings. When in the SUSPENDED state, changes in base tables will\nnot trigger refreshes, nor will they be reflected in the queryable data of the Cortex Search Service.",
        "SERVING is the target that indicates the serving layer of the Cortex Search Service. This target must be in the RUNNING state for the\nservice to be queryable. When in the suspended state, the Cortex Search Service will not incur billing\nin the form of Cortex Search\u2019s serving costs.",
        "For detailed cost considerations, see Cost considerations.",
        "The INDEXING and SERVING layers of the Cortex Search Service can be managed independently. For instance, if SERVING is in the running\nstate while INDEXING is suspended, you can still query the service. However, the service will not reflect any changes in the base data\nregardless of the TARGET_LAG until INDEXING is resumed and a refresh is completed successfully.",
        "Conversely, if INDEXING is running while SERVING is suspended, the index will continue to refresh. When SERVING is resumed, the loaded\nindex that becomes queryable will reflect the most up-to-date source data.",
        "When neither the SERVING nor INDEXING keywords are specified, both targets will be impacted by the specified action.",
        "The following example changes warehouse used by the Cortex Search service named mysvc to my_new_wh:",
        "The following example sets the comment field of the Cortex Search service named mysvc to new_comment:",
        "The following example changes the target refresh lag of the Cortex Search service named mysvc to 1 hour:",
        "The following example suspends serving for a Cortex Search service named mysvc;",
