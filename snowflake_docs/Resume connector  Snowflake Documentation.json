        "Resuming the connector is available after the wizard. It can be executed after the Finalize Configuration additionally with Pause Connector.\nThis step allows user to manipulate the status of the connector after it is launched. The entry point for this phase is a procedure\ncalled PUBLIC.RESUME_CONNECTOR(). It can be customized by replacing it in SQL or by using ResumeConnectorHandlerBuilder.\nThe reverse process of resuming the connector, allowing user to suspend it, is Pause connector.",

By default, it invokes PUBLIC.RESUME_CONNECTOR_INTERNAL(), which returns 'response_code': 'OK'.\nThis procedure allows the user to perform any additional duties needed when resuming connector. For example resuming additional connector specific tasks.\nIt can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using a ResumeConnectorHandlerBuilder to provide custom implementation of the ResumeConnectorCallback interface.",
