        "Tasks let you schedule the execution of SQL code. A task is associated with a specific database and schema. You can use\nSnowsight to view and manage your tasks and task graphs. Using Snowsight, you can also view the execution history for\ntasks and tasks graphs and retry failed tasks.",
        "To view and manage a task in Snowsight, do the following:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "Select Data \u00bb Databases.",
        "For a specific database and schema, select Tasks and select the task you want to manage.",
        "When viewing the task in Snowsight, you can do the following:",
        "In the Details section, review the task ID, warehouse used by the task, schedule, state, parameters, and any conditions.",
        "Review the SQL statement used to create the task and any task graph configurations in the Task Definition section.",
        "Manage privileges on the task. See Manage object privileges with Snowsight.",
        "Select the \u2026 actions button to edit the task, clone the task, drop the task, or transfer ownership of the task to another role.",
        "When you edit a task in Snowsight, the task is automatically suspended and resumed when you finish editing the task. For more\ninformation about suspending and resuming tasks, see Versioning of task runs.",
        "Review a task graph to see a root task, its dependent tasks, and finalizer task in the format of a task graph. For more information about task graphs, see Manage task dependencies with task graphs. When you review a task graph, you can do the following in Snowsight:",
        "View task information.",
        "Examine the task graph.",
        "Select a task on the graph to view additional details, such as predecessor tasks, the warehouse used to run the task, and the role that\nowns the task.",
        "You can also edit the root task to change parameters for the task graph. When you edit a task in Snowsight, the task is\nautomatically suspended and resumed when you finish editing the task. For more information about suspending and resuming tasks, see\nVersioning of task runs.",
        "To view a task graph for a specific database schema, do the following:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "In the navigation menu, select Data \u00bb Databases.",

        "Note",
        "Task history data is only available if the task has been executed in the last 7 days.",
        "Using Snowsight, you can review the execution history for tasks in different ways:",
        "View the execution history of all tasks run in your account, for example to identify critical tasks that failed to run, long-running\ntasks, or tasks increasing costs.",
        "View the execution history for a specific task, to gather more information about the task.",
        "View the execution history for a task graph, for observability and monitoring purposes and to help identify problems with a specific task\ngraph.",
        "You can also review task history in SQL by using a table function TASK_HISTORY or a\nview TASK_HISTORY view.",
        "To view task history in Snowsight, you need the same privileges required to run the\nTASK_HISTORY function.",
        "You must use one of the following roles:",
        "The ACCOUNTADMIN role.",
        "A role with the OWNERSHIP privilege on the task.",
        "A role with the global MONITOR EXECUTION privilege and the USAGE privilege on the database and schema that store the task.",

        "For example, to identify long-running tasks, select the Status filter to show only successful tasks,\nand sort the Duration field in descending order. For advanced debugging, you can open the filtered and sorted table in worksheets\nusing the Open in worksheets button. You could then modify the SQL statement with LIMIT / FETCH\nand GROUP BY arguments to identify the databases and schemas with the top 25 most long-running tasks.",

        "After selecting the database and optional schema, filter on the name of the root task name to see patterns in status or duration over time\nfor specific task types. You might see root tasks that your active role does not have privileges to view.",
        "For example, to identify task graphs with failing tasks, select the Graph status filter to show only failed tasks. You can hover\nover a failed task for more details about the failure. For advanced debugging, open the filtered and sorted table in worksheets using the\nOpen in worksheets button. You could then modify the SQL statement with LIMIT / FETCH and\nGROUP BY arguments to identify, for example, the databases and schemas with the top 25 failing tasks.",

        "For example, you can select a specific failed task graph run to view the full graph and identify tasks that did not run as a result of\nspecific failed tasks, suspended tasks, or identify a long-running task that is delaying a dependent task run in the graph.",
        "For a specific task in the task graph, you can gather additional details about the task by hovering over various aspects of the task:",

        "In addition to the task graph, you can review a table describing which tasks ran, the start time of each task,\nthe duration of each task run, the status of each task, and a timeline representing the sequence of task runs. With the timeline, you\ncan quickly determine why a task graph run was slow, and which long-running task might have delayed the start of a dependent task.",
