        "In the Snowflake architecture, virtual warehouses provide the computing power that is required to execute queries. Fine-tuning the compute\nresources provided by a warehouse can improve the performance of a query or set of queries.",
        "A warehouse owner or administrator can try the following warehouse-related strategies as they attempt to improve the performance of one or\nmore queries. As they adjust a warehouse based on one of these strategies, they can test the change by re-running the query and\nchecking its execution time.",
        "Warehouse-related strategies are just one way to boost the performance of queries. For performance strategies involving how data\nis stored, refer to Optimizing storage for performance.",
        "Strategy",
        "Description",
        "Reduce queues",
        "Minimizing queuing can improve performance because the time between submitting a query and getting its results is longer when the\nquery must wait in a queue before starting.",
        "Resolve memory spillage",
        "Adjusting the available memory of a warehouse can improve performance because a query runs substantially slower when a warehouse runs\nout of memory, which results in bytes \u201cspilling\u201d onto storage.",
        "Increase warehouse size",
        "The larger a warehouse, the more compute resources are available to execute a query or set of queries.",
        "Try query acceleration",
        "The query acceleration service offloads portions of query processing to serverless compute resources, which speeds up the processing\nof a query while reducing its demand on the warehouse\u2019s compute resources.",
        "Optimize the warehouse cache",
        "Query performance improves if a query can read from the warehouse\u2019s cache instead of from tables.",
        "Limit concurrently running queries",
        "Limiting the number of queries that are running concurrently in a warehouse can improve performance because there are fewer queries\nputting demands on the warehouse\u2019s resources.",
        "Tip",
        "Optimizing a warehouse for query performance is more straightforward when the warehouse runs similar workloads. For example, if a\nwarehouse runs significantly different queries, the cost of a performance enhancement might be wasted on a query that does not benefit\nfrom the optimization.",
        "For general guidelines about distributing workloads to your organization\u2019s warehouses, see the Analyzing Your Workloads section of\nthe Managing Snowflake\u2019s Compute Resources (Snowflake blog).",
