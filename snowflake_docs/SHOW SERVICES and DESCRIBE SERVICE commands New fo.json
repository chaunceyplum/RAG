    "paragraphs": [
        "Attention",
        "This behavior change is in the 2024_06 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "The SHOW SERVICES and DESCRIBE SERVICE commands behave as follows:",
        "The dns_name column in the output of these commands contains the Snowflake-assigned DNS name of a service in the following format:",
        "service-name.schema-name.db-name.snowflakecomputing.internal",
        "The format of the DNS name in the column has changed to:",
        "service-name.unique-id.svc.spcs.internal",
        "The major changes in the format are:",
        "unique-id replaces the schema-name.db-name and is a 4-8 character long alphanumeric identifier that is unique\nto a particular instance of a database schema.",
        "To find the unique ID for a schema, call the SYSTEM$GET_SERVICE_DNS_DOMAIN function. For example:",
        "Note the following:",
        "If you rename a schema, the identifier remains unchanged.",
        "If you drop and recreate a schema with the same name, the identifier will change.",
        "snowflakecomputing is replaced by svc.spcs to reduce the verbosity of the fully qualified DNS name of the service.",
        "Note the following:",
        "This is a change in the behavior of the CREATE SERVICE command. When a service is created, Snowflake assigns the DNS name to a service.",
        "However, the effects of this behavior change are visible when you use the SHOW SERVICES and DESCRIBE SERVICE commands, which include the DNS name in the output.",
        "For services deployed after the 2024_06 bundle is enabled, the old style DNS names will continue to work for some time. Snowflake recommends that you update your code to use the new DNS format.",
