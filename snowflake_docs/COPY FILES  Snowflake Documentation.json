        "For the INTO and FROM parameters:",
        "namespace is the database or schema in which the internal or external stage resides,\nin the form of database_name.schema_name or schema_name.\nThe namespace is optional if a database and schema are currently in use within the user session; otherwise, it is required.",
        "path is an optional, case-sensitive path in the cloud storage location that specifies a set of files to copy from the source\nstage or a specific location on the target stage. Your cloud storage service might call the path a prefix or a folder.",
        "Note",
        "If a target or source path name includes special characters or spaces, you must enclose the INTO ... or FROM ...\nvalue in single quotes.",
        "The values for INTO ... and FROM ... must be literal constants.\nThe values cannot be SQL variables.",
        "Specifies a list of one or more comma-separated file names to copy.\nThe files must already be staged in the source location that you specify in the command.\nSnowflake skips any specified files that can\u2019t be found.",
        "You can specify a maximum of 1000 file names.",
        "Note",
        "To set the file path for external stages, Snowflake prepends the URL in the stage definition to each file name in the list.",
        "However, Snowflake does not insert a separator between the path and file name.\nYou must explicitly include a separator (/) at the end of the URL in the stage definition\nor at the beginning of each file name in the FILES list.",
        "Specifies a regular expression pattern for filtering the list of files to copy.\nThis command applies the regular expression to the entire storage location in the FROM clause.",

        "Specifies whether the command output should summarize the results of the copy operation or list each file copied.",

        "Considerations for running this command:",
        "COPY FILES statements overwrite any existing files with matching names in the target location. The command does\nnot remove any existing files that don\u2019t match the names of the copied files.",
        "If a file copy operation fails, Snowflake does not perform any automatic cleanup.",
        "Copying files from Google Cloud Storage: A COPY FILES statement might fail if the object list for an external stage includes\none or more directory blobs. A directory blob is a path that ends in a forward slash character (/). In the following example output\nfor LIST @<stage>, my_gcs_stage/load/ is a directory blob.",
        "Google creates directory blobs when you use the Google Cloud console to create a directory.",
        "To avoid this issue, use the PATTERN option to specify which files to copy.\nFor an example, see Copy files using pattern matching.",
        "The COPY FILES command incurs data transfer and compute costs:",
        "Data transfer: Cloud providers might charge for data transferred out of their own network. To recover these expenses,\nSnowflake charges a per-byte fee when you copy files from an internal Snowflake stage\ninto an external stage in a different region\nor with a different cloud provider. Snowflake does not charge for data ingress\n(for example, when copying files from an external stage into an internal stage).",
        "For more information about data transfer billing, see Understanding data transfer cost.",
        "Compute: COPY FILES is a serverless feature and doesn\u2019t require a virtual warehouse.\nThe line item for the COPY FILES command on your Snowflake bill does not include any cloud services charges.",

        "Note",
        "Some Snowflake features, such as Native Apps and worksheets, incur COPY FILES charges. As a result, you might see\nCOPY FILES charges even if you haven\u2019t executed the COPY FILES command. For more information about these charges,\ncontact Snowflake Support.",
