        "This topic describes how to gain insight into historical storage costs using Snowsight, or by writing queries against views in\nthe ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE schemas.\nSnowsight allows you to quickly and easily obtain information about cost from a visual dashboard. Queries against the usage views\nallow you to drill down into cost data and can help generate custom reports and dashboards.",
        "To gain a better understanding of how storage costs are incurred, see Understanding storage cost.",
        "Users can use Snowsight to view the amount of data that is stored in Snowflake.",
        "To explore storage costs:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "Switch to the ACCOUNTADMIN role. If you are not the account administrator, switch to a role with access to cost and usage data.",
        "Navigate to Admin \u00bb Cost Management.",
        "Select a warehouse to use to view the usage data. Snowflake recommends using an XS warehouse for this purpose.",
        "Select Consumption.",
        "Select Storage from the Usage Type drop-down.",
        "For usage notes related to the Consumption page, see Usage notes.",
        "To help attribute cost to a logical unit within your organization, you can filter the Usage\ndashboard to show storage associated with a specific tag/value combination. This ability to filter storage by tag is similar to filtering\ncredit consumption by tag. For details, refer to Exploring Compute Costs.",
        "When viewing the bar graph that displays storage history, you can filter the data either By Type or By Object.",
        "Filtering By Type shows the size of storage for each storage type: Database, Fail Safe, and Stage. Storage\nassociated with Time Travel is included in the Database category.",
        "Filtering By Object graphs the size of storage for each object, for example the size of a particular database or stage.",

        "Click on any table to view the table statistics, including its size.",
        "Important",
        "The size displayed for a table represents the number of active bytes. In most cases, this is the number of bytes that will be scanned\nif the entire table is scanned in a query. However, this number might be different from the number of physical bytes (i.e. bytes stored\non-disk) for the table, specifically for cloned tables and tables with deleted data:",
        "A cloned table does not utilize additional storage (until rows are added to the table or existing rows in the table are modified or\ndeleted). As a result, the table size displayed may be larger\nthan the actual physical bytes stored for the table, i.e. the table contributes less to the overall storage for the account\nthan the size indicates.",
        "Data deleted from a table is not included in the displayed table size; however, the data is maintained in Snowflake until both the\nTime Travel retention period (default is 1 day) and the Fail-safe period (7 days) for the data has passed. During these two periods,\nthe table size displayed is smaller than the actual physical bytes stored for the table, i.e. the table contributes more\nto the overall storage for the account than the size indicates.",
        "Dropping a column from a table does not immediately delete the data in the column. The physical bytes for the data in the dropped\ncolumn remain in storage. In this case, the table size displayed is larger than the number of bytes that is scanned if the\nentire table is scanned in a query. For more information, see the usage notes for\nALTER TABLE.",
        "For more information about storage for cloned tables and deleted data, see Data storage considerations.",
        "You can write SQL queries to gain insights into tables, including their size, instead of using the web interface.",
        "A user with the proper access privileges can list data about tables using the SHOW TABLES command.",
        "In addition, users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can use SQL to view table size information by executing queries against the\nTABLE_STORAGE_METRICS view in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema.",
        "For important information about interpreting the table data retrieved by these SQL queries, see the note in\nViewing data usage for a table (in this topic).",
        "Snowflake provides two schemas, ORGANIZATION_USAGE and\nACCOUNT_USAGE, that contain data related to usage and cost. The ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema provides\ncost information for all of the accounts in the organization while the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema provides similar information for a single\naccount. Views in these schemas provide granular, analytics-ready usage data to build custom reports or dashboards.",
        "Most views in the ORGANIZATION_USAGE and ACCOUNT_USAGE schemas contain the cost of storage in terms of the size of storage. To view cost\nin currency rather than size, write queries against the USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY view. This view\nconverts the size of storage into cost in currency using the daily price of a TB.",
