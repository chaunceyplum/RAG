        "Snowflake Data Clean Rooms allow multiple parties to collaborate together in a secure environment. These collaborators can combine and\nanalyze data without worrying about the privacy concerns that go with sharing raw data.",
        "In a Snowflake Data Clean Room, collaborators are able to return aggregated results and insights from a dataset, but cannot access the data\ndirectly. The collaborator who is sharing their data defines what analyses are available to the other collaborators, allowing them to\ntightly control how their data is used.",
        "Snowflake Data Clean Rooms are designed for both business and technical users. The web app provides a user interface that allows\nnon-technical users to work with clean rooms, including running analyses without writing SQL queries. The developer edition provides APIs\nso technical users can programmatically create and use clean rooms.",
        "Snowflake customers can use a Snowflake Data Clean Room to collaborate with other Snowflake customers or with parties who do not have a\nSnowflake account. Parties without a Snowflake account simply accept an invitation to use a clean room managed account to begin\ncollaborating in the clean room.",
