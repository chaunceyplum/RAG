        "To aid Snowflake Support in diagnosing customer incidents, the Snowflake JDBC driver utilizes a diagnostic service that runs in the background. When the driver encounters an issue that\nprevents it from performing normally, the diagnostic service records information about the issue in a pair of compressed dump files located in the /tmp/snowflake_dumps folder:",
