        "Snowflake provides a CLI (command line interface) as well as other client software (drivers, connectors, etc.) for connecting to Snowflake and using certain\nSnowflake features (e.g. Apache Kafka for loading data, Apache Hive metadata for external tables). The clients must be installed on each local workstation or system from which\nyou wish to connect.",
        "As needed, we release new versions of the clients to fix bugs, and introduce enhancements and new features. New versions are backward-compatible with existing Snowflake\nfeatures, but we do not guarantee that earlier versions are forward-compatible. As such, we recommend actively monitoring and maintaining the versions of your installed\nclients; if they are not in-sync with the current version of Snowflake, you may encounter issues when connecting to and using Snowflake.",
        "For more information about determining the current version of a client or driver, refer to the following:",

        "How to report on the Clients connecting to a Snowflake account?",
        "All downloads on this page are considered \u201cClient Software\u201d as defined in your agreement for use of the Snowflake Service.",
        "Attention",
        "Customers who use GCP (Google Cloud Platform) for authentication must update their clients and drivers to new\nminimum versions due to upcoming changes by Google for signing request headers and payloads.\nSnowflake recommends affected customers read the\nFAQ: 2023 Client Driver deprecation for GCP customers knowledge\nbase article for more information.",
        "As a policy, Snowflake recommends that you always install the latest (i.e. most recent) version of each client,\nif possible.",
        "Snowflake uses semantic versioning for client and driver updates.",
        "Note",
        "Snowflake\u2019s support policy generally provides a minimum two-year window for clients and drivers, after which support might be dropped.\nTo help you track supported versions, the following table includes the minimum version of clients and drivers Snowflake currently\nsupports. If you use a version older than the minimum, Snowflake makes no commitment to provide support.",
        "Once a client is installed, you are not required to upgrade each time a new version is released; however, to stay current with the\nlatest fixes, updates, and features, we recommend monitoring for new versions and upgrading at regular intervals (e.g. monthly,\nquarterly, semiannually).",
