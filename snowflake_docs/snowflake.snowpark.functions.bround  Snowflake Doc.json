        "Rounds the number using HALF_TO_EVEN option. The HALF_TO_EVEN rounding mode rounds the given decimal value to the specified scale (number of decimal places) as follows:\n* If scale is greater than or equal to 0, round to the specified number of decimal places using half-even rounding. This rounds towards the nearest value with ties (equally close values) rounding to the nearest even digit.\n* If scale is less than 0, round to the integral part of the decimal. This rounds towards 0 and truncates the decimal places.",
