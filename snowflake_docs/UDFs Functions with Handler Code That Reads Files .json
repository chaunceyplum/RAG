        "Attention",
        "This behavior change is in the 2023_03 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "UDFs whose handler code reads files from a stage will execute in the owner\u2019s context.\nA caller must pass the file location as a scoped URL, whether the handler code is in a UDF or procedure and regardless of whether\nthey are running with caller\u2019s or owner\u2019s rights:",
        "When Java code in a UDF handler reads a file from a stage, it does so using the caller\u2019s context.",
        "A caller may pass the file\u2019s location to the function using a form such as select my_function('@stage-name/filename.txt').",
        "Handler code receives the stage URL and reads the file with SnowflakeFile.newInstance and SnowflakeFile.getInputStream or\nreceives the file as a java.io.InputStream:",
        "Files read by handler code may be on an external stage or on a user or named internal stage.",
        "When Java code in a UDF handler reads a file from a stage, it will do so using the owner\u2019s context.",
        "For both UDFs and procedures, a caller must pass the file\u2019s location in a scoped URL by using the BUILD_SCOPED_FILE_URL function, as in the following function example:",
        "select my_func(build_scoped_file_url(@my_stage, 'filename.txt'));",
        "Handler code receives the scoped URL and reads the file as before.",
        "For files whose locations are specified within handler code (not as scoped URLs passed in by a caller), you can read the staged file in one of two ways: handler code can call the newInstance method with a boolean value for a new requireScopedUrl parameter; or handler code must use a scoped URL when creating an InputStream from the file path.",
        "The following example uses SnowflakeFile.newInstance:",
        "In addition, user stages are no longer supported as locations for files read by a handler. Files read by handler code must be on an\nexternal stage or on a named internal stage.",
