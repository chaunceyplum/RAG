Each character in the delimiter string is a delimiter.\nIf the delimiter is empty, and the string is empty, then the function returns NULL. If the\ndelimiter is empty, and the string is non empty, then the whole string will be treated as one token.\nThe default value of the delimiter is a single space character.",

        "In this example, because the input string is empty, there are 0 elements, and therefore\nelement #1 is past the end of the string, so the function returns NULL rather than an empty string:",
