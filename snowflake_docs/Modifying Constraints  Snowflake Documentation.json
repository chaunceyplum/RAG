        "Some properties can be modified, e.g. RELY.",
        "Some properties cannot be modified, e.g. such as DEFERRABLE. To modify these properties, the constraint must be dropped and recreated.",
        "The column definition for a constraint cannot be modified, e.g. add new columns, drop existing columns, or change the order of columns. To make these types of changes, the constraint must be dropped\nand recreated.",
        "When modifying a constraint, the constraint can be identified using either the constraint name or the columns in the constraint definition along with the type of the constraint. Primary keys can also be\nidentified using the PRIMARY KEY keyword, because each table can have only a single primary key.",

        "For descriptions of the constraint properties, see Constraint properties.",
        "If a table with constraints is renamed, the constraints for the table, as well as any foreign key constraints that reference the table are updated to reference the new name.",
        "Likewise, if a table is swapped with another, existing table, all the constraints on the table are maintained on the swapped table.",
