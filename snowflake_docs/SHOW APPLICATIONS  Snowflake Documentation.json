        "Lists the application objects for which you have access privileges across your entire account in the Snowflake Native App Framework.",
        "The output returns metadata and properties for the application object, ordered lexicographically by name.\nThis is important to note if you wish to filter the results using the provided filters.",
        "ALTER APPLICATION, CREATE APPLICATION, DESCRIBE APPLICATION, DROP APPLICATION",
        "Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL\nwildcard characters (% and _).",
        "For example, the following patterns return the same results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "For example, the following strings return different results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output)",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",

        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'B' LIMIT ... FROM 'A' would return no results.",
