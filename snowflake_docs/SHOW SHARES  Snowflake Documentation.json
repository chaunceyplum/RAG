        "For example, the following patterns return the same results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "For example, the following strings return different results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output)",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",

        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'B' LIMIT ... FROM 'A' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'AB' would return results (if any rows match the input strings).",

        "A user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can delegate this privilege. See Enable non-ACCOUNTADMIN roles to perform data sharing tasks.",
        "If a user without the IMPORT SHARE privilege runs this command, no shares are listed.",
        "Note",
        "Executing this command without sufficient privileges returns empty results.",
        "Columns that start with the prefix is_ return either Y (yes) or N (no).",
        "The command does not require a running warehouse to execute.",
        "The command returns a maximum of 10K records for the specified object type, as dictated by the access privileges for the role used to execute the command; any records above the 10K limit\nare not returned, even with a filter applied.",
        "To view results for which more than 10K records exist, query the corresponding view (if one exists) in the Snowflake Information Schema.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",

        "OUTBOUND indicates that your account is sharing data with other accounts and this share was created in your account.",
        "For OUTBOUND shares, if accounts have been added to the share, the to column displays these accounts. The maximum number\nof accounts displayed in this column is three; however, there is no hard limit on the number of accounts that can be added to a share.",
