        "A resource monitor can help control costs and avoid unexpected credit usage caused by running warehouses. A\nvirtual warehouse consumes Snowflake credits while it runs. You can use a resource monitor\nto monitor credit usage by virtual warehouses and the cloud services needed to support those warehouses. You can also set up a resource\nmonitor to suspend a user-managed virtual warehouse when it reaches a credit limit.",
        "The number of credits consumed depends on the size of the warehouse and how long it runs. For more information on warehouse credit usage,\nsee Virtual warehouse credit usage.",
        "Credit usage limits can be set for a specified interval or date range. When a limit is reached and/or reaches a specified threshold,\nthe resource monitor can trigger various actions, such as sending alert notifications and/or suspending user-managed warehouses.",
        "Only users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can create a resource monitor, but an account administrator can grant privileges to other roles\nto allow other users to view and modify resource monitors.",
        "A resource monitor is a first-class object in Snowflake, consisting of the following properties:",
        "Credit quota specifies the number of Snowflake credits allocated to the monitor for the specified frequency interval. Any number can be specified.",
        "In addition, Snowflake tracks the used credits/quota within the specified frequency interval by all warehouses assigned to the monitor.\nAt the specified interval, this number resets to 0.",
        "Credit quota accounts for credits consumed by both user-managed virtual warehouses and virtual warehouses used by cloud services.",
        "For example, your resource monitor limit is set at 1000 credits. If your warehouse consumes 700 credits, and cloud services consume 300\ncredits within a specified interval or date range, an alert will be triggered.",
        "Note",
        "Resource monitor limits do not take into account the daily 10% adjustment for cloud services. Snowflake uses all credit consumption by\nthe cloud services layer to calculate whether a limit has been reached, even if that consumption is never billed. For more information\nabout how cloud services credits and adjustments are calculated, see Understanding billing for cloud services usage.",
        "For instructions on how to view your cloud services credit usage, see Exploring compute cost.",
        "This property specifies whether the resource monitor is used to monitor your account or a specific set of individual warehouses:",
        "An account monitor monitors the credit usage of all the warehouses in the account. An account can only have one account monitor.",
        "A warehouse monitor monitors the credit usage of the warehouses assigned to the resource monitor. An account can have multiple\nwarehouse monitors.",
        "A warehouse monitor can have one or more warehouses assigned to it, but each warehouse can only be assigned to one resource monitor.",
        "If this property is not set, the resource monitor doesn\u2019t monitor any credit usage. It simply remains dormant.",
        "For more information, see Assignment of resource monitors.",
        "The default schedule for a resource monitor specifies that it starts monitoring credit usage immediately and the used credits reset to\n0 at the beginning of each calendar month (i.e. the start of the standard Snowflake billing cycle).",
        "However, you can optionally customize the schedule for a resource monitor using the following properties:",
        "The interval at which the used credits reset relative to the specified start date.",
        "Supported values:",
        "Daily",
        "Weekly",
        "Monthly",
        "Yearly",
        "Never (used credits never reset; assigned warehouses continue using credits until the credit quota is reached)",

        "Supported values:",
        "Immediately (i.e. current timestamp)",
        "Later (i.e. any future timestamp)",
        "In addition, Snowflake uses this date to determine when to reset the used credits, based on the specified frequency. Note, however, that\nregardless of the time specified in the start date and time, resource monitors reset at 12:00 AM UTC. For example, if the start is\n15-July-2019 (Monday) at 8:00 AM:",
        "Frequency = Monthly: Used credits reset at 12:00 AM UTC on the 15th of each following month.",
        "Frequency = Weekly: Used credits reset at 12:00 AM UTC on each following Monday.",
        "Note that, if you specify the last day of a month as the start date, Snowflake resets the used credits on the last day of all following\nmonths, regardless of the number of days in the month. For example, if you set the start date to January 31, Snowflake subsequently resets\nthe used credits for the resource monitor on February 28 (or February 29 in a leap year), March 31, April 30, and so on.",
        "Date and time (i.e. timestamp) when Snowflake suspends the warehouses associated with the resource monitor, regardless of whether the\nused credits reached any of the thresholds defined for the resource monitor\u2019s actions (see the next section in this topic).",
        "Supported values: Any future timestamp.",
        "Note that this property is not commonly used.",
        "Important",
        "If you choose to customize the schedule for a resource monitor, the frequency is relative to the specified start date, which is\ndifferent than the default schedule.",
        "Also, if you specify a frequency, you must also specify a start date and time, and vice versa (i.e. you cannot set one without setting the\nother).",
        "Also referred to as triggers, each action specifies a threshold, as a percentage of the credit quota for the resource monitor, and the\naction to perform when the threshold is reached within the specified interval. Note that actions support thresholds greater than 100.",
        "Resource monitors support the following actions:",
        "Send a notification and suspend all assigned warehouses after all statements being executed by the warehouse(s) have completed.",
        "Send a notification and suspend all assigned warehouses immediately, which cancels any statements being executed by the warehouses\nat the time.",
        "Perform no action on warehouses, but send a notification.",
        "Notifications are sent to all account administrators with notifications enabled. Email notifications for resource monitors that monitor\nwarehouses are also sent to any non-administrator user that is enabled\nto receive those notifications.",
        "Note",
        "Non-administrator users can only receive email notifications for warehouse monitors.",
        "Each resource monitor can have the following actions:",
        "One Suspend action.",
        "One Suspend Immediate action.",
        "Up to five Notify actions.",
        "Note",
        "A resource monitor must have at least one action defined; if no actions have been defined, nothing happens when the used credits reach\nthe threshold.",
        "A single monitor can be set at the account level to control credit usage for all warehouses in your account.",
        "In addition, a one or more warehouses can be assigned to a resource monitor, thereby controlling the credit usage for each assigned\nwarehouse. Note, however, that a warehouse can be assigned to only a single resource monitor below the account level.",
        "The following diagram illustrates a scenario in which one resource monitor is set at the account level and individual warehouses are\nassigned to two other resource monitors:",
        "Based on this diagram:",
        "The credit quota for the entire account is 5000 for the interval (month, week, etc.), as controlled by Resource Monitor 1; if this quota\nis reached within the interval, the actions defined for the resource monitor (Suspend, Suspend Immediate, etc.) are enforced for\nall five warehouses.",
        "Warehouse 3 can consume a maximum of 1000 credits within the interval.",
        "Warehouse 4 and 5 can consume a maximum combined total of 2500 credits within the interval.",
        "Note that the actual credits consumed by Warehouses 3, 4, and 5 may be less than their quotas if the quota for the account is reached first.",
        "Important",
        "An account-level resource monitor does not override resource monitor assignment for individual warehouses. If either the account\nresource monitor or the warehouse resource monitor reaches its defined threshold and a suspend action has been defined, the warehouse is\nsuspended.",
        "An account-level resource monitor does not control credit usage by the Snowflake-provided compute resources for serverless features (for\nexample, Snowpipe, automatic reclustering, and materialized views).",
        "A warehouse-level resource monitor can monitor, but cannot suspend, credit usage by cloud services. After a virtual warehouse is\nsuspended, subsequent queries run against that warehouse can still result in additional cloud services costs. For more information\nabout credit usage for cloud services, see Cloud service credit usage.",
        "The used credits for a resource monitor reflect the sum of credits consumed by all assigned warehouses within the specified interval,\nalong with the cloud services used to support those warehouses during the same interval. If a monitor has a Suspend or Suspend\nImmediately action defined and its used credits reach the threshold for the action, any warehouses assigned to the monitor are suspended\nand cannot be resumed until one of the following conditions is met:",
        "The next interval, if any, starts, as dictated by the start date for the monitor.",
        "The credit quota for the monitor is increased.",
        "The credit threshold for the suspend action is increased.",
        "The warehouses are no longer assigned to the monitor.",
        "The monitor is dropped.",
        "Tip",
        "Resource monitors are not intended for strictly controlling consumption on an hourly basis; they are intended for tracking and\ncontrolling credit consumption per interval (day, week, month, etc.). Also, they are not intended for setting precise limits on credit\nusage (i.e. down to the level of individual credits). For example, when credit quota thresholds are reached for a resource monitor, the\nassigned warehouses may take some time to suspend, even when the action is Suspend Immediate, thereby consuming additional credits.",
        "If you wish to strictly enforce your quotas, we recommend the following:",
        "Utilize buffers in the quota thresholds for actions (e.g. set a threshold to 90% instead of 100%).",
        "This will help ensure that your credit usage doesn\u2019t exceed the quota.",
        "To more strictly control credit usage for individual warehouses, assign only a single warehouse to each resource monitor.",
        "When multiple warehouses are assigned to the same resource monitor, they share the same quota thresholds, which may result in credit\nusage for one warehouse impacting the other assigned warehouses.",
        "When a resource monitor reaches the threshold for an action, it generates a notification\nsimilar to the following notification:",
        "The <action> is one of the following actions:",
        "NOTIFY",
        "SUSPEND",
        "SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE",
        "Notification behavior depends on the type of resource monitor and whether or not notifications\nare enabled for an individual user. Notifications are sent as follows:",
