        "You can use this command to list objects in the current database and schema for the session, a specified database or schema, or\nyour entire account.",
        "The output includes the metadata and properties for each object. The objects are sorted lexicographically by database, schema,\nand object name (see Output in this topic for descriptions of the output columns). The order is important to note if you want to\nfilter the results.",
        "CREATE SNAPSHOT, ALTER SNAPSHOT, DESCRIBE SNAPSHOT, DROP SNAPSHOT",
        "Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL\nwildcard characters (% and _).",
        "For example, the following patterns return the same results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Optionally specifies the scope of the command. Specify one of the following:",
        "Returns records for the entire account.",
        "Returns records for the current database in use or for a specified database (db_name).",
        "If you specify DATABASE without db_name and no database is in use, the keyword has no effect on the output.",
        "Returns records for the current schema in use or a specified schema (schema_name).",
        "SCHEMA is optional if a database is in use or if you specify the fully qualified schema_name (for example, db.schema).",

        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",

        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",

        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
