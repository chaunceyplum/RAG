        "Snowflake requires a virtual warehouse to load the\ndata and execute queries. A running virtual warehouse consumes Snowflake credits.\nIn this tutorial, you will be using a 30-day trial account,\nwhich provides free credits, so you won\u2019t incur any costs.",
        "In this tutorial you will learn how to:",
        "Use a role that has the privileges to create and use the Snowflake objects required by this tutorial.",

        "You have a trial account. If you do not have a trial account yet, you can sign up\nfor a free trial. You can choose any Snowflake Cloud Region.",
        "Your user is the account administrator and is granted the ACCOUNTADMIN system role. For more information, see\nUsing the ACCOUNTADMIN Role.",
        "Note",
        "This tutorial is only available to users with a trial account. The sample worksheet is not available\nfor other types of accounts.",
        "To access Snowsight over the public Internet, do the following:",
        "In a supported web browser, navigate to https://app.snowflake.com.",
        "Provide your account identifier or account URL.\nIf you\u2019ve previously signed in to Snowsight, you might see an account name that you can select.",
        "Sign in using your Snowflake account credentials.",
        "You can use worksheets to write and run SQL commands on your database.\nYour trial account has access to a pre-loaded template worksheet for this tutorial.\nThe worksheet contains the SQL commands that you will run to set the role context,\ncreate a user, and grant role privileges. Because it is a template worksheet, you\nwill be invited to enter your own values for certain SQL parameters.",

        "In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the USE ROLE line.",

        "LOGIN_NAME, as specified in the CREATE USER command.",
        "PASSWORD, as specified in the CREATE USER command.",
        "Now that you have created a user, you can use the SECURITYADMIN role to grant the\nSYSADMIN role to the user, as well as grant USAGE on the COMPUTE_WH warehouse.",
        "Granting a role to another role creates a parent-child relationship between the roles\n(also referred to as a role hierarchy). Granting a role to a user enables the user to perform\nall operations allowed by the role (through the access privileges granted to the role).",
        "The SYSADMIN role has privileges to create warehouses, databases, and database objects\nin an account and grant those privileges to other roles. Only grant this role to users who should\nhave these privileges. For information about other system-defined roles, see\nOverview of Access Control.",
        "To grant the user access to a role and a warehouse, do the following:",
        "In the open worksheet, place your cursor in the USE ROLE line,\nthen select Run.",

        "The ACCOUNTADMIN role is not normally used to create objects. Instead, we recommend creating a\nhierarchy of roles aligned with business functions in your organization. For more information, see\nUsing the ACCOUNTADMIN Role.",
