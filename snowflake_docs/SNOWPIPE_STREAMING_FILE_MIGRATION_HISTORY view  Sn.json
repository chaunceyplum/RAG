        "Note that file migration sometimes may be pre-empted by clustering or other DML operations. Migration may not always occur and therefore the migration history will be empty even after 12 hours.",
        "The NUM_BYTES_MIGRATED and NUM_ROWS_MIGRATED columns only show the number of bytes and rows processed during the migration process. These numbers may not equal the actual numbers of rows and bytes inserted by Snowpipe Streaming to the table because some rows and bytes are processed outside of the migration process due to clustering or other DML operations.",
        "For example, Snowpipe Streaming inserts 1M rows and the table has 1M rows, but the NUM_ROWS_MIGRATED column in the migration history view only shows 800K rows. This is because the other 200K rows are processed outside of the migration process.",
