        "You can use Snowsight and the power of Snowflake Cortex to automatically generate descriptions for a column, table, or view.\nSnowflake Cortex leverages Snowflake-hosted large language models (LLMs) to evaluate object metadata and, if\ndesired, sample data to generate the description.",

        "When generating a description for a column, you can rely only on metadata, or you can choose to use sample data to\nimprove the Snowflake Cortex Powered Description. Sample data refers to data within a particular column that is evaluated when you\nuse Snowflake Cortex to generate descriptions. If you choose to use sample data, Snowflake uses a portion of the sample data to generate the\ndescription, which leads to more accurate descriptions. Sample data is not stored by Snowflake as usage data.",
        "The decision to use sample data is specific to the individual user. The first time you generate a column description in a browser\nsession, you will be prompted to decide whether to use sample data. The pop-up box defaults to yes and allows you to choose to disable\nsample data before proceeding. Your browser stores your response to this question for the duration of your\nSnowflake session and you won\u2019t be asked again until your next session.
