        "A pipe is considered stale when it is paused for longer than the limited retention period for event messages received for the pipe\n(14 days by default). As each notification reaches the end of this period, Snowflake schedules it to be dropped from the internal\nmetadata. If the pipe is later resumed, Snowpipe may process notifications older than 14 days on a best effort basis. Snowflake cannot\nguarantee that these older notifications are processed.",
