        "Snowflake offers two broad categories of powerful, intelligent features based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and\nMachine Learning (ML). These features can help you do more with your data in less time than ever before.",
        "Snowflake Cortex is a suite of AI features that use large language models (LLMs) to understand unstructured data,\nanswer freeform questions, and provide intelligent assistance. This suite of Snowflake AI Features comprises:",
        "Snowflake Cortex LLM Functions",
        "Snowflake Copilot",
        "Document AI",
        "Cortex Fine-tuning",
        "Cortex Search",
        "Cortex Analyst",
        "Snowflake ML provides functionality for you to build your own models.",
        "ML Functions simplify the process of creating and using traditional machine\nlearning models to detect patterns in your structured data. These powerful out-of-the-box analysis tools help\ntime-strapped analysts, data engineers, and data scientists understand, predict, and classify data, without any\nprogramming.",
        "For data scientists and developers, Snowflake ML lets you develop\nand operationalize custom models to solve your unique data challenges, while keeping your data inside Snowflake.\nSnowflake ML incorporates model development classes based on popular ML frameworks, along with ML Ops capabilities\nsuch as a feature store, a model registry, framework connectors, and immutable data snapshots.",
        "Snowflake AI Features and their underlying models are designed with the following principles in mind:",
        "Full security. Except as you elect, all AI models run inside of Snowflake\u2019s security and governance perimeter. Your data is not\navailable to other customers or model developers.",
        "Data privacy. Snowflake never uses your Customer Data to train models made available to our customer base.",
        "Control. You have control over your team\u2019s use of Snowflake AI Features through familiar\nrole-based access control.",
        "Snowflake is continually working to improve the quality of its offerings, including the models powering the Snowflake AI Features.\nThis section describes how updates to those models fit into Snowflake\u2019s Behavior Change process.",
        "At Snowflake, feature updates are announced and deployed in the following 3 types of releases:",
        "Bundled Behavior Changes - Once a month release that introduces behavior changes.",
        "Unbundled Behavior Changes - Unbundled releases are not\nassociated with a bundled or standard weekly release.",
        "What\u2019s new - Newly released features or important updates to existing features.",
        "Model updates follow a similar pattern of announcements. For model updates, the following would constitute a behavior change:",
        "Required syntax changes (e.g. specifying a new model or model version in the function parameter).",
        "Required prompts or input updates to get similar results.",
        "Significant changes in structure of the model output.",
        "Deprecation of a model.",
        "Bundled behavior changes would include most anticipated behavior changes, including:",
        "Model deprecation in the ordinary course, such as planned deprecation by the model provider or Snowflake (including those on which\nfine-tuning is permitted).",
        "Model updates, e.g. new versions or new models, that may result in changes to syntax, prompts, or output structure.",
        "Unbundled behavior changes would typically be reserved for the following:",
        "Model deprecation for emergency reasons, e.g. concerns about the quality of a model or its outputs.",
        "Lastly, What\u2019s new denotes general improvements that would likely not constitute a behavior change and therefore would be\nautomatically included. This would typically be the following:",
        "Model updates or new versions (whether provided by a third party or Snowflake) that improve results but have no anticipated material\neffect on how you interact with the model.",
        "The following table shows some examples of model updates and how they would be announced:",
        "Type of update",
        "Unbundled behavior change",
        "Bundled behavior change",
        "What\u2019s new",
        "A new version of the Jamba model is released but has no anticipated material effect on how you interact with the model.",
        "\u2714",
        "A new Llama model is made available through Snowflake.",
        "\u2714",
        "One of the Mistral models is deprecated.",
        "\u2714",
        "An update to the TRANSLATE model results in a change in the output structure.",
        "\u2714",
        "A model is deprecated due to safety concerns regarding the model output.",
        "\u2714",
        "If you choose to use any of the Snowflake AI Features, your use is subject to our\nAcceptable Use Policy.",
        "The outputs of Snowflake AI Features may be inaccurate, inappropriate, inefficient, or biased. Decisions based on such\noutputs, including those built into automatic pipelines, should have human oversight and review processes to ensure they are\nsafe, accurate, and suitable for your intended use.",
        "Your use of any Snowflake AI Feature that is identified as being powered by a third-party, open-source model is subject to any\napplicable license agreement and/or acceptable use policy set forth under the Offering-Specific Terms page available at\nhttps://www.snowflake.com/legal/.",
