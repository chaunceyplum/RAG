        "Includes dropped schemas that have not yet been purged (i.e. they are still within their respective Time Travel retention periods).\nIf multiple versions of a dropped schema exist, the output displays a row for each version. The output also includes an additional\ndropped_on column, which displays:",
        "Date and timestamp (for dropped schemas)",
        "NULL (for active schemas).",
        "Default: No value (dropped schemas are not included in the output)",
        "Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL\nwildcard characters (% and _).",

        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Specifies the scope of the command, which determines whether the command lists records only for the current/specified database or\nacross your entire account.",
        "The APPLICATION and APPLICATION PACKAGE keywords are not required, but they specify the scope for the named Snowflake Native App.",
        "The DATABASE keyword is not required; you can set the scope by specifying only the database name. Likewise, the database name\nis not required if the session currently has a database in use.",
        "Default: Depends on whether the session currently has a database in use:",

        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",

        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",

        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",

        "If a CREATE <object> privilege is included in the privileges list, the command excludes objects for which secondary roles have\nbeen granted privileges. This is because only the primary role has the authorization to create objects. For more information, see\nEnforcement model with primary role and secondary roles.",
        "When you specify the scope to either APPLICATION or the database named SNOWFLAKE, the owner column returns\nSNOWFLAKE as the owner for the schema named LOCAL. For example:",

        "To view results for which more than 10K records exist, either include LIMIT rows or query the corresponding view in the Snowflake Information Schema.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",
