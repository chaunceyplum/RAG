        "Grants access privileges for databases and other supported database objects (schemas, UDFs, tables, and views) to a share. Granting\nprivileges on these objects effectively adds the objects to the share, which can then be shared with one or more consumer accounts.",

        "REVOKE <privilege> \u2026 FROM SHARE",

        "Specifies the identifier for the schema for which the specified privilege is granted for all tables.",
        "Specifies the identifier for the share from which the specified privilege is granted.",
        "The USAGE privilege on only a single database can be granted to a share; however, within that database, privileges on multiple schemas,\nUDFs, tables, and views can be granted to the share.",
        "Privileges on individual objects must be granted to a share in separate GRANT statements. The only exception is the SELECT privilege on\ntables (including Apache Iceberg\u2122 tables). Using an ALL clause, you can grant SELECT on all tables in a specified schema to a share.",
        "The SELECT privilege on views can only be granted on secure views. Attempting to grant the SELECT privilege on a non-secure view to a\nshare returns an error.",
        "The USAGE privilege can only be granted on secure UDFs. Attempting to grant the USAGE privilege on a non-secure UDF to a share returns\nan error.",
        "Currently, sharing a UDF that references an object from another database is not supported. For example, if you attempt to grant USAGE\non a UDF that references a secure view from another database, an error is returned.",
        "Use the REFERENCE_USAGE privilege when sharing a secure view that references objects belonging to multiple databases, as follows:",
        "The REFERENCE_USAGE privilege must be granted individually on each database.",
        "The REFERENCE_USAGE privilege must be granted on a database before granting the SELECT privilege on a secure view to a share.",
        "For more details, see Share data from multiple databases.",
        "Secure Data Sharing: Data providers cannot add new objects to a share automatically using\nfuture grants. That is, data providers cannot grant privileges on future objects to a share using\nGRANT <privilege> \u2026 TO SHARE statements.",
        "You cannot reshare a database or database objects created from a share. If you attempt to grant the USAGE privilege on a database or\ndatabase objects created from a share to a different share, an error is returned.",
        "If you specify a TABLE object that is an Iceberg table, the command grants the privilege on that Iceberg table.",
