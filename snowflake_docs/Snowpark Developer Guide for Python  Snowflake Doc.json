        "The Snowpark library provides an intuitive API for querying and processing data in a data pipeline.\nUsing the Snowpark library, you can build applications that process data in Snowflake without moving data to the system where your\napplication code runs. You can also automate data transformation and processing by writing stored procedures and scheduling those\nprocedures as tasks in Snowflake.",
        "You can write Snowpark Python code in a local development environment or in a Python worksheet in Snowsight.",
        "If you need to write a client application, set up a local development environment by doing the following:",

        "If you want to write a stored procedure to automate tasks in Snowflake, use Python worksheets in Snowsight.\nSee Writing Snowpark Code in Python Worksheets.",
        "You can query, process, and transform data in a variety of ways using Snowpark Python.",

        "Run your pandas code directly on your data in Snowflake. See pandas on Snowflake.",
        "Convert custom lambdas and functions to user-defined functions (UDFs) that you can call to process data.\nSee Creating User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for DataFrames in Python.",
        "Write a user-defined tabular function (UDTF) that processes data and returns data in a set of rows with one or more columns.\nSee Creating User-Defined Table Functions (UDTFs) for DataFrames in Python.",
