        "To configure a client, driver, library, or application to connect to Snowflake, you must specify your Snowflake account\nidentifier. In addition, you might need to specify the warehouse, database, schema, and role that should be used.",
        "Clients, connectors, and drivers use a variety of syntaxes to connect to Snowflake. In general, you should use the variation\nthat includes the organization name (orgname) and account name (account_name), with the following exception: If you use the Client Redirect feature, replace the name of the account (account_name) with the name of the connection (connection_name). For examples of this syntax, see Using a connection URL.",
        "To configure a private connection to the Snowflake service, add .privatelink to either the account name or the account locator syntax. To determine which value you should use to connect to Snowflake when using private connectivity, call the SYSTEM$GET_PRIVATELINK_CONFIG function in your Snowflake account.",
        "If you need to use the account locator, you might also need to specify the cloud region ID, the cloud, and the level of government\ncompliance as additional segments after the account locator. For the format to use, see Format 2: Account locator in a region. In the\nexamples below, account_locator_with_additional_segments represents the account location with any additional segments\nthat are required.",
