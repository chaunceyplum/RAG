    "paragraphs": [
        "Cortex Analyst transforms natural-language questions about your data into results by generating and executing SQL queries.\nThis tutorial describes how to set up Cortex Analyst to respond to questions about a time-series revenue data set.",
        "Establish a semantic model for the data set.",
        "Create a Streamlit app that queries Cortex Analyst.",
        "The following prerequisites are required to complete this tutorial:",
        "You have a Snowflake account and user with a role that grants the necessary\nprivileges to create a database, schema, tables, stage, and virtual warehouse objects.",
        "You have Streamlit set up on your local system.",
        "Refer to the Snowflake in 20 minutes for instructions to meet these requirements.",
        "You will use a sample dataset downloaded\nfrom GitHub.\nDownload the following data files to your system:",
        "daily_revenue.csv",
        "product.csv",
        "region.csv",
        "Also download the semantic model YAML from GitHub.",
        "You might want to take a look at this semantic model before proceeding. The semantic model supplements the SQL schema of\neach table with additional information that helps Cortex Analyst understand questions about the data. For more\ninformation, see Cortex Analyst semantic model specification.",
        "Note",
        "In a non-tutorial setting, you would bring your own data, possibly already in a Snowflake table, and develop\nyour own semantic model.",
        "Use Snowsight, the Snowflake UI, to create the Snowflake objects needed for this tutorial. After you complete the\ntutorial, you can drop these objects.",
        "Note",
        "Use a role that can create databases, schemas, warehouses, stages, and tables.",
        "To create the objects:",
        "In the Snowsight user interface, select Worksheets in the left navigation bar, then select the +\nbutton. A new SQL worksheet appears.",
        "Paste the SQL code below into the worksheet, then select the Run All from the drop-down menu at the top right\nof the worksheet.",
        "The SQL above creates the following objects:",
        "A database named cortex_analyst_demo",
        "A schema within that database called revenue_timeseries",
        "Three tables in that schema: DAILY_REVENUE, DAILY_REVENUE_BY_PRODUCT, and DAILY_REVENUE_BY_REGION",
        "A stage named raw_data that will hold the raw data we will load into these tables",
        "A virtual warehouse named cortex_analyst_wh",
        "Note that the virtual warehouse is intially suspended, and will start automatically when it is needed.",
        "To get the data from the CSV files into Snowflake, you will upload them to the stage, then load the data from the stage\ninto the tables. At the same time, you will upload the semantic model YAML file for use in a later step.",
        "The files you will upload are:",
        "daily_revenue.csv",
        "product.csv",
        "region.csv",
        "revenue_timeseries.yaml",
        "To upload the files in Snowsight:",
        "In the Snowsight UI, select the Data icon in the left navigation bar, then Add Data. In the Add Data page,\nselect Load files into a stage.",
        "Drag the four files you downloaded in the previous step into the Snowsight window.",
        "Choose the database cortex_analyst_demo and the stage raw_data, then select the Upload button to upload the files.",
        "Now that you have uploaded the files, load the data from the CSV files by executing the SQL commands below in a Snowsight worksheet.",
        "To create a Streamlit app that uses Cortex Analyst:",
        "Create a Python file locally called analyst_demo.py.",
        "Copy the code below into the file.",
        "Replace the placeholder values with your account details.",
        "Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run analyst_demo.py.",
        "When you run the app, it prompts you to enter a question. Start with \u201cWhat questions can I ask?\u201d and try some of its suggestions.",
        "Execute the following DROP <object> commands to return your system to its state before you began the tutorial:",
        "Dropping the database automatically removes all child database objects such as tables.",
        "Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple Cortex Analyst app to \u201ctalk to your data\u201d in Snowflake.",
        "Continue learning using the following resources:",
