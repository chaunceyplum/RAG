        "Use this view to get a historical view of Snowpark Container Services internal data transfers in your account for the last 365 days.",
        "This view reports the following two types of internal data transfers:",
        "SERVICE_FUNCTION: When a service function is invoked, it sends a request to its associated service. Note that the query invoking the service functions executes in a warehouse, while the  service runs in a compute pool. There is an internal data transfer cost associated with it. The view captures any data exchanged during the request and response as an internal data transfer of the SERVICE_FUNCTION type.",
        "COMPUTE_POOL: Through service-to-service communication, a service can transfer data to another service running in a different compute pool. This incurs internal data transfer costs, which the view reports as data transfer cost with the COMPUTE_POOL transfer type.",
