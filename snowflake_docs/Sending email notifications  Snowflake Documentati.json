        "To send an email notification:",
        "Make sure that the intended recipients verify their email addresses.",
        "Create a notification integration.",
        "Call a stored procedure to send the notification.",
        "You can send email notifications only to Snowflake users within the same account. Those users must verify their email addresses\nthrough one of the following interfaces:",
        "Snowsight (the Snowflake Web Interface)",
        "Classic Console",
        "To send email notifications, use an email notification integration that you create with the\nCREATE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION command.",
        "Note",
        "You must use a role that has the global CREATE INTEGRATION privilege to run this command.",
        "For example, to create an email notification integration named my_email_int, execute the following statement:",
        "Note",
        "All Snowflake customers can send email messages using this feature. Email messages sent from the Notifications System Stored\nProcedure are processed through Snowflake\u2019s Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments, using AWS Simple Email Service (SES). The\ncontent of an email message sent using AWS may be retained by Snowflake for up to thirty days to manage the delivery of the\nmessage. After this period, the message content is deleted.",
        "If you want to restrict the list of email addresses that can receive notifications through this integration, set\nALLOWED_RECIPIENTS to the list of those email addresses. If you do not set ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS, the integration can be used to\nsend notifications to any user in the account, provided that the\nemail address has been verified.",
        "Note",
        "For each email address in ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS, make sure that the email address has been verified. If you specify an email\naddress that hasn\u2019t been verified, the CREATE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION command fails with an error.",
        "For example, to restrict the notification integration so that email messages can be sent only to first.last@example.com and\nfirst2.last2@example.com, set ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS to the list of those addresses:",
        "For details about the syntax of this command, see CREATE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION (email).",
        "If you are using the SYSTEM$SEND_SNOWFLAKE_NOTIFICATION stored\nprocedure to send email notifications, you can configure the notification integration with a default list of email addresses\nand a default subject line to use. You can override the default list and subject line when you call the stored procedure.",
        "To specify a default list of email addresses, set the DEFAULT_RECIPIENTS property of the notification integration.",
        "To specify a default subject line, set the DEFAULT_SUBJECT property of the notification integration.",
        "For example, suppose that you want to set up an email notification integration for the following purpose:",
        "You want to send most email notifications to person_a@example.com and person_b@example.com, but you also want the\nability to send the notifications to the validated email addresses of any users in your account.",
        "You want most messages to use the subject line \u201cService status\u201d, but you want to be able to use a different subject line for\nspecific messages.",
        "To create an email notification for this purpose, execute the following command:",
        "When sending the notification, you can override the list of default recipients and the default subject line. See\nOverride the default values in the email notification integration.",
