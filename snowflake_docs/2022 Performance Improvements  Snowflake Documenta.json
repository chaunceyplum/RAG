        "Important",
        "Performance improvements often target specific query patterns or workloads. These improvements might or might not have a material impact\non a specific workload.",

        "Ability to enable Search Optimization for specific columns. (Preview)",
        "Point lookup queries that act upon a column can be improved without incurring the expense of enabling Search Optimization for the\nentire table.",
        "October 2022",
        "Support for substring operations when using Search Optimization.\n(Preview)",
        "Improves the performance of point lookup queries that use substring operations such as LIKE and ENDSWITH.",

        "October 2022",
        "Improvements for Collation and BINARY columns.",
        "Improved pruning for collations and BINARY columns, which means fewer\nmicro-partitions must be scanned to return results.",
