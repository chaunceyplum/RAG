        "The DATABASE or SCHEMA keyword is not required; you can set the scope by specifying only the database or schema name.\nLikewise, the database or schema name is not required if the session currently has a database in use.",

If the data retention period is set at the schema or database level, the current role and account must have access to the relevant object (schema, database, or shared tables/views) to obtain an accurate stale_after timestamp. . . This time can be inaccurate in a few cases: . - Some time can elapse between when the stream is permitted to become stale and when the underlying data is actually dropped. During this period, stale_after will be in the past, but reading from the stream may succeed. The duration of this period is subject to change, so you should not depend on it. . - If parameters affecting table retention are increased, streams that are already stale will remain stale, but the stale_after time might be in the future.",
