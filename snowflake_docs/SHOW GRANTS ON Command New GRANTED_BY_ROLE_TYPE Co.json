        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "In the current release, the output of the SHOW GRANTS ON <object_type> <object_name> command syntax includes a new GRANTED_BY_ROLE_TYPE column.\nThe column indicates whether the grantor role is an account role or database role (ROLE or DATABASE_ROLE, respectively).",
        "To help limit the impact of this change, the column is the last column in the output.",

        "The column is limited to the SHOW GRANTS ON <object_type> <object_name> command syntax. Other syntax variations for the command will\nnot include this column.",
