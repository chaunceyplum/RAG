        "Preview Feature \u2014 Open",
        "Available to accounts in all regions in all cloud providers (including government regions). For details, contact your Snowflake representative.",
        "The connectors native SDK consists of multiple components, some of them are independent and some of them depend on each other to work.\nThis section explains how to customize which components will be turned on in the connector.\nAdditionally, each component will be shortly described and their dependencies will be mentioned.",
        "Components are enabled and disabled on the Snowflake database objects level. This means that the executed setup.sql\nfile is the source of truth on what was enabled or disabled. For the first time users it is recommended to use the all.sql file provided by the SDK.\nThis file includes all of the basic features from the SDK (except Task Reactor).",
        "To do so simply put the following line in the setup.sql file of the connector:",
        "For more experienced users it is possible to customize enabled and disabled features.\nTo do so add and remove EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statements as needed.\nKeep in mind that excluding a file which is required by the feature will break it.",
        "The sections below contain a list of the connectors native SDK components\nwith short descriptions and a list of required other components for each of them.\nFor more information, see The Snowflake Native SDK for Connectors reference.",
        "The core component is responsible for creating basic objects for the connector like schemas,\nroles and persistence layer for the internal status of the application.",
        "This component has no dependencies to other components.",
        "The application configuration component is a persistence layer for storing and reading\nthe internal configuration of the application.",
        "This component has no dependencies to other components.",
        "Prerequisites are an optional part of the wizard.\nIt supports informing the end user about configurations and initial setup that needs to be satisfied,\nusually outside of the connector itself.",
        "Core component",
        "The connector configuration is a wizard step responsible for configuring common\nconnector properties like: sink database, data owner role, warehouse etc.",
        "Core component",
        "Application configuration component",
        "The connection configuration is a wizard step responsible for configuring\nthe properties related to the communication with the external source system for the connector,\nfor example authentication and authorization properties and methods.",
        "Core component",
        "Application configuration component",
        "The finalize connector is a wizard step responsible for performing final connection checks to the external source system and connector specific configurations.",
        "Core component",
        "Recommended: Application configuration component",
        "The pause/resume component provides the option of pausing and resuming the connector whenever desired to stop the credit consumption.",
        "Core component",
        "Recommended: Application configuration component",
        "Recommended: Finalize configuration component",
        "The ingestion component provides abstraction and persistence to define the data that will be put into Snowflake from the external source system.",
        "This component has no dependencies to other component, however requires multiple sql files to be executed.",
        "The scheduler component allows provides a mechanism of triggering tasks inside a connector\naccording to the configuration using Snowflake tasks underneath.",
        "Core component",
        "Application configuration component",
        "Connector configuration component",
        "The connectors stats component provides useful views to see the metadata from the performed ingestion tasks.\nIt is useful to monitor how much data is flowing through the connector.",
        "Ingestion component",
        "The sync status component provides a view to quickly check when was the last data sync.",
        "Ingestion component",
        "Connector stats component",
        "The task reactor is a component that provides a mechanism to queue work items and spread them between a number of worker tasks.\nThe number of workers can be changed to allow for more of them when there are huge workloads.",
        "This component has no dependencies to other components.",
