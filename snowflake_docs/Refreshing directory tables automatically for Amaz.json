        "This topic provides instructions for creating directory tables and refreshing the directory table metadata automatically using Amazon SQS\n(Simple Queue Service) notifications for an S3 bucket.

Integration objects store an AWS identity and access management (IAM) user ID. An administrator in your organization grants the integration IAM user permissions in the AWS account.",
