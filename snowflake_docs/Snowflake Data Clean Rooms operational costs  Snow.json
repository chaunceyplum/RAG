This operation prevents\nconsumers from being able to increase their daily query budget by altering or resetting their current differential privacy\nbudget usage. In order to provide the highest fidelity for this enforcement, this operation needs to validate the consumer\u2019s true\nremaining daily budget every minute. This operation is set up when a user enables differential privacy in a clean room. You can control\nthis cost by disabling the differential privacy task.",
