        "Document AI incurs cost in the following ways:",
        "Document AI enables extracting information from documents using the <model_build_name>!PREDICT\nmethod, which incurs compute cost.",
        "To run queries in worksheets (including using the <model_build_name>!PREDICT method),\nyou select a warehouse. Additionally, Document AI can incur costs for other operations related to retrieving data\nin the worksheets. For information about selecting warehouse size for Document AI,\nsee Determining optimal warehouse size for Document AI.",
        "To test the Document AI model, you upload the documents to the Document AI user interface in Snowsight, where you\nreview the results and optionally fine-tune the model by training. These operations might incur storage costs because the results\nare stored within a Snowflake class object in your account. To extract information by using SQL, you upload the documents\nto either an internal or external stage, which might also incur storage costs. For information about viewing incurred storage costs,\nsee Exploring storage cost.",
        "For more information about overall cost at Snowflake, see Understanding overall cost.",
        "Document AI uses Snowflake-managed compute resources, which are automatically scaled up or down by Snowflake as required for\neach Document AI workload. With the Snowflake-managed compute structure, the consumption is based on the time spent actually\nusing these resources. In contrast, user-managed virtual warehouses consume credits while running, regardless of whether they are\nperforming any work, so they might be idle or overused.",
        "The calculation of credit consumption for Document AI is based on the total amount of compute resources used to complete the job.\nThe amount of compute resources used is measured by the type of compute and the time spent and calculated on a per-second basis\nacross all resources used by the workload, rounded up to the nearest whole second.",
