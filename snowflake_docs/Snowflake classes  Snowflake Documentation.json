        "The SNOWFLAKE database also includes Classes provided by Snowflake.",
        "A Class is similar to a class in object oriented programming and serves as a blueprint for creating instances. An Instance is an\nobject created from a Class. Classes and instances are schema-level objects in Snowflake. You can think of a class as an extensible\nSnowflake object type and an instance as a Snowflake object.",
        "A class provides a public API through stored procedures and functions. Collectively they are referred to as class methods. A\nclass also provides class roles that enable fine-grained privileges on class methods. In addition to its public API, a class\nincludes private state and private procedures and functions, similar to private properties and methods in object oriented programming.\nThe implementation of a class can evolve over time through new class versions. Instances are upgraded to the latest class version\nautomatically by Snowflake.",
        "For example, Snowflake provides the ANOMALY_DETECTION class in the SNOWFLAKE.ML\nschema. You can create an instance of a class using a CREATE command just as you would create an object of a specific object type.",
        "The example below creates an instance of a class and calls an instance method.",
        "Update your search path to include SNOWFLAKE.ML:",
        "Create an instance of ANOMALY_DETECTION class:",
        "After you create an instance of the ANOMALY_DETECTION class, you can call instance methods:",
        "Note",
        "Currently, classes are only provided by Snowflake and cannot be created by users.",
        "You can find available classes and learn more about each class using SHOW commands. These commands allow you to:",
        "Find all available classes in the SNOWFLAKE database.",
        "List class methods.",
        "List class roles.",
        "List all the available Snowflake classes by executing the SHOW CLASSES command:",
        "The results of this statement include the database and schema name for each class.",
        "Classes are objects in a schema in the SNOWFLAKE database. You must use the fully qualified class name (for example,\nSNOWFLAKE.ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION) to execute the SQL commands that follow in this topic. Alternatively, you can update the\nsearch path to include the database and schema for a class, then refer to\nthe class by its unqualified name (for example, ANOMALY_DETECTION).",
        "Note",
        "If you update the search path for a particular class, functions that have the same name but that are part of\na different class will no longer be accessible. For example, if you add SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX to your search path,\nthe string function TRANSLATE won\u2019t be accessible since the\nSNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE function exists.",
        "You can modify the search path using ALTER SESSION, ALTER USER, or ALTER ACCOUNT.",
        "Command",
        "Notes",
        "ALTER SESSION",
        "Modifies the search path for the current session only. You can modify your own search path at the session level.\nA session-level change overrides the account-level or user-level setting.",
        "ALTER USER",
        "Modifies the search path persistently for the current or specified user. You can modify your own search path at\nthe user level. An administrator can modify another user\u2019s search path. A user-level change overrides the\naccount-level or session-level setting.",
        "ALTER ACCOUNT",
        "Modifies the search path persistently for all users in the account. An administrator must modify the search path\nat the account level.",
        "Execute the following statement and copy your current search path from the value column:",
        "Update your search path.",
        "Note",
        "The examples below use the default search path, $current, $public. If your search path in the value\ncolumn from the previous step does not match the default value, edit the example statements below to include your actual\nsearch path.",
        "For example, to add SNOWFLAKE.ML to your search path for your current session, execute the following statement:",
        "To add SNOWFLAKE.ML to your own search path at the user level, execute the following statement:",
        "A user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can update the search path for the account by executing the following statement:",
        "For more information on how Snowflake resolves names, see Object name resolution.",
        "A class provides a public API through stored procedures and functions. Collectively they are referred to as class methods. To list\nall the methods for a class, including the arguments required for each method, execute the\nSHOW FUNCTIONS IN CLASS and\nSHOW PROCEDURES IN CLASS commands. A class might include multiple methods with the same name\nbut different signatures (that is to say, a different number of arguments or argument data types).",
        "Note",
        "The example statements in this topic use the non-qualified class name ANOMALY_DETECTION. If you have not\nupdated your search path to include SNOWFLAKE.ML, use the fully qualified\nname for the SNOWFLAKE.ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION class.",
        "For example, to list all the functions available in the SNOWFLAKE.ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION class, execute the following statement:",
        "To list all the stored procedures in the SNOWFLAKE.ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION class, execute the following statement:",
        "The results below include the stored procedures in the class for which the current role in the session has been granted\naccess privileges:",
        "A class might have one or more roles that are granted the USAGE privilege on some or all class methods. You can list the available roles in\na class using the SHOW ROLES IN CLASS command.",
        "List all the roles in the SNOWFLAKE.ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION class:",
        "Roles are defined in the class and instantiated in the instance as an instance role. An instance role can be granted to a role in your\naccount to enable access to instance methods.",
        "For example, if you have an ANOMALY_DETECTION instance my_anomaly_detector in schema my_db.my_schema, you can view\nthe privileges granted to the instance role USER using the following statement:",
        "To grant the instance role to role my_role in your account, execute the following statement:",
        "The above statement enables the role my_role to execute methods of the ANOMALY_DETECTOR instance my_anomaly_detector.",
        "Note",
        "The role my_role must also have the USAGE privilege on database my_db and schema my_schema.\nRole my_role must also have the appropriate privileges on objects passed to instance methods.",
        "In order to create an instance of a class, a role must be granted the CREATE <class_name> privilege.",
        "For example, to enable the ml_admin role to create SNOWFLAKE.ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION instances in the mydb.myschema\nschema, execute the following statement:",
        "You can create an instance of a class using the CREATE <object> command and the class constructor method.",
        "Note",
        "Instance names in a schema must be unique irrespective of the class they were created from. For example, if you have\nan instance of the BUDGET (SNOWFLAKE.CORE) class named foo, you can\u2019t create an instance of the\nANOMALY_DETECTION (SNOWFLAKE.ML) class named foo in the same schema.",
        "For example, to create an anomaly detector my_anomaly_detector instance, execute the following statement:",
        "After you create an instance of a class, you can call the instance methods that the class\nprovides. Calling a method requires the exclamation point (!) character. The ! character is used to dereference\nthe instance.",
        "For example, to call the DETECT_ANOMALIES method of the anomaly detector my_anomaly_detector, execute the following\nstatement:",
        "Some methods return tabular data (for example, methods in the ANOMALY_DETECTION\nand FORECAST classes). To select and manipulate this tabular data, you can call these\nmethods in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement.",
        "When calling the method, omit the CALL command. Instead, put the call in parentheses, preceded by the\nTABLE keyword:",
        "For example, to select the ts, forecast, and is_anomaly columns from the tabular data returned by the\nDETECT_ANOMALIES method of the anomaly detector\nmy_anomaly_detector:",
        "If you pass in a reference to a query, the query cannot refer to any common table expressions\ndefined outside of the reference. For example, executing the following statement results in an error because the query reference\nrefers to my_data, which is defined in the outer WITH clause:",
        "To work around this limitation, move the WITH clause inside the query reference:",
        "For a list of available Snowflake classes, see SQL class reference.",
