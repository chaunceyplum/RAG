        "Streamlit in Snowflake apps serve both HTTPS-encrypted traffic and WebSocket-encrypted traffic. The Streamlit browser client application is mounted in a third-party, cross-origin\niframe within Snowsight. This enables strict cross-site browser isolation control.",
        "Streamlit in Snowflake uses a separate URL scheme for specific security requirements. Streamlit URLs have their own top-level domain with no shared elements\nwith Snowsight. Each Streamlit app has a unique origin.",

        "When using AWS PrivateLink or Azure Private Link, you control the DNS resolution; there are no PrivateLink DNS records controlled by Snowflake.",
