        "All Snowflake customers can send email messages using this feature. Email messages sent from the Notifications System Stored\nProcedure are processed through Snowflake\u2019s Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments, using AWS Simple Email Service (SES). The\ncontent of an email message sent using AWS may be retained by Snowflake for up to thirty days to manage the delivery of the\nmessage. After this period, the message content is deleted.",
        "This topic explains how to use the built-in SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL stored procedure to send\nemail notifications.",
        "This feature uses the notification integration object, which is a Snowflake\nobject that provides an interface between Snowflake and third-party services (e.g. cloud message queues, email, etc.).",
        "Before you send a notification, you must have a notification integration that you will use to send the notification. You must also\nvalidate the email addresses of the recipients. For details, see Notifications in Snowflake.",
        "To send the email notification, call the SYSTEM$SEND_EMAIL stored procedure.",
        "For example, to use the notification integration my_email_int to send an email message with the subject line\n\u201cEmail Alert: Task A has finished.\u201d to first.last@example.com and first2.last2@example.com, execute the following statement:",
        "Note",
        "If you set the ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS property of the notification integration, and any email address in the recipient list is not\non that list, no email notifications are sent.",
        "If you are on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, then the email notification message is sent from\nno-reply@snowflake.net. If you are on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Microsoft Azure (Azure)\ncloud platform, the email notification message is sent from do-not-reply@snowflake.net.",
