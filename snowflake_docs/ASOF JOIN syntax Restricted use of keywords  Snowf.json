        "This behavior change is in the 2024_01 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "The ASOF JOIN feature behaves as follows:",
        "The use of ASOF and MATCH_CONDITION as object names, object aliases, session variables,\nand bind variables is not restricted.",
        "ASOF and MATCH_CONDITION are new keywords. The use of these keywords in SELECT commands\nand commands that set or use session or bind variables is restricted.",
        "Names of objects",
        "If a SELECT statement uses ASOF or MATCH_CONDITION as the name of a table, view, or inline view, you must\nidentify it as follows:",
        "If the object was created with double quotes in the name, use the same double-quoted name.",
        "If the object was created without double quotes in the name, use double quotes and capital letters.",
        "For example, the following statements are no longer allowed and return errors:",
        "If you created the objects with double quotes, fix the problem by using double quotes:",
        "If you created the objects without double quotes, fix the problem by using double quotes and capital letters:",
        "Note",
        "Snowflake recommends that you discontinue the use of these object names in your applications.",
        "Names of aliases",
        "If a SELECT statement uses ASOF or MATCH_CONDITION as an alias, you must use AS before the alias or double-quote\nthe alias. For example, the following statements are no longer allowed and return errors:",
        "Fix the problem in one of the following ways:",
        "Names of variables",
        "If you are using session variables or bind variables with the name ASOF or MATCH_CONDITION,\nand their names were not double-quoted when they were created, they must be renamed or removed.",
        "For example, you can no longer set a session variable named asof:",
        "However, you can set a variable that is explicitly double-quoted and named \"asof\" or \"ASOF\":",
        "The same rules apply to bind variables, such as :asof and :match_condition.",
