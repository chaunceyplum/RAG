        "The measurement of similarity between vectors is a fundamental operation in semantic comparison. For example, you need\nthis operation to find the top N number of closest vectors to a query vector, which can be used for a semantic search. Vector\nsearch also enables developers to improve the accuracy of their generative AI responses by providing related documents\nto a large language model.",
