        "This behavior change is in the 2024_04 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "With this behavior change bundle, Snowpark Container Services now supports fine-grained access control allowing you to manage access privileges for endpoints that a service exposes. You can now grant a service role (defined in the service specification) access privileges to a specific endpoint and use service roles to control who can access the service endpoints.",
        "Note",
        "The owner role for a service always has access to that service\u2019s endpoints. This change applies only if the current role is not the owner role.",
        "The privileges required to create or alter a service function are changing:",
        "Privileges required to create and manage service functions:",
        "To create a service function: The current role must have the USAGE privilege on the service being referenced.",
        "To alter a service function: You can alter a service function and associate it with another service. The current role must have the USAGE privilege on that other service.",
        "Privileges required to create and manage service functions:",
        "To create a service function: The current role must have the USAGE privilege on the endpoint. You grant this privilege by granting the service role to the current role.",
        "To alter a service function: You can alter a service function and associate it with another endpoint. The current role must have been granted the service role with the USAGE privilege on the new endpoint being referenced.",
        "Users in the Snowflake account where the service is created can use  ingress to a public endpoint. The privileges required to use the public endpoint are changing:",
        "The current role must have the USAGE privilege on a service that exposes the endpoint.",
        "The current role must have the USAGE privilege on the endpoint. You grant this privilege by granting the service role to the current role.",
        "The list of endpoints returned by this command is changing:",
        "Returns a list of all the endpoints associated with the service.",
