        "This function returns a value of type VARCHAR.",
        "If any argument is NULL, NULL is returned.",
        "If the partNumber is out of range, the returned value is an empty string.",
        "If the string starts or is terminated with the delimiter, the system\nconsiders empty space before or after the delimiter, respectively, as a\nvalid part of the split result. For an example, see the Examples section below.",
        "If the partNumber is 0, it is treated as 1. In other words, it gets the first element of the split.\nTo avoid confusion over whether indexes are 1-based or 0-based, Snowflake recommends avoiding the use of 0\nas a synonym for 1.",
        "If the separator is an empty string, then after the split, the returned value is the input string (the\nstring is not split).",

        "This example returns the first and second parts of a string of characters that are separated by vertical bars. The\nseparator is the first part of the input string, so the first element after the split is an empty string.",
        "This example shows a multi-character separator:",
        "The following example shows that if the separator is an empty string, then after the split, there is still only one\nstring:",
