        "ALTER MODEL \u2026 MODIFY VERSION sets a model version\u2019s comment or metadata.",
        "Specifies the identifier (i.e. name) of the model.",

        "For more information, see Identifier requirements.",
        "Specifies one or more model properties to be set.",
        "Sets the comment of the model. This can also be done using the COMMENT command.",
        "Sets the default version of the model (the version that methods are invoked on when calling a method directly on the\nmodel). The version name is an identifier.",

        "For more details about identifiers, see Identifier requirements.",
        "You can move the object to a different database and/or schema while optionally renaming the object. To do so, specify\na qualified new_name value that includes the new database and/or schema name in the form\ndb_name.schema_name.object_name or schema_name.object_name, respectively.",
