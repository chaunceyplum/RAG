        "Registering a UDAF is like registering a scalar UDF, you can use register() or snowflake.snowpark.functions.udaf()\nto explicitly register it. You can also use the decorator @udaf. They all use cloudpickle to transfer the code from the client to the server.\nAnother way is to use register_from_file(). Refer to module snowflake.snowpark.udaf.UDAFRegistration for when to use them.",
        "To query a registered UDAF is the same as to query other aggregate functions. Refer to agg().\nIf you want to query a UDAF right after it\u2019s created, you can call the created UserDefinedAggregateFunction instance like in Example 1 below.",
