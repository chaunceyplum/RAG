        "Multi-cluster warehouses enable you to scale compute resources to manage your user and query concurrency needs as they change, such as during\npeak and off hours.",
        "By default, a virtual warehouse consists of a single cluster of compute resources available to the\nwarehouse for executing queries. As queries are submitted to a warehouse, the warehouse allocates resources to each query and begins\nexecuting the queries. If sufficient resources are not available to execute all the queries submitted to the warehouse, Snowflake queues the\nadditional queries until the necessary resources become available.",
        "With multi-cluster warehouses, Snowflake supports allocating, either statically or dynamically, additional clusters to make a larger pool\nof compute resources available. A multi-cluster warehouse is defined by specifying the following properties:",
        "Maximum number of clusters, greater than 1 (up to 10).",
        "Minimum number of clusters, equal to or less than the maximum (up to 10).",
        "Additionally, multi-cluster warehouses support all the same properties and actions as single-cluster warehouses, including:",
        "Specifying a warehouse size.",
        "Resizing a warehouse at any time.",
        "Auto-suspending a running warehouse due to inactivity; note that this does not apply to individual clusters, but rather the entire\nmulti-cluster warehouse.",
        "Auto-resuming a suspended warehouse when new queries are submitted.",
        "You can choose to run a multi-cluster warehouse in either of the following modes:",
        "This mode is enabled by specifying the same value for both maximum and minimum number of clusters (note that the\nspecified value must be larger than 1). In this mode, when the warehouse is started, Snowflake starts all the clusters so\nthat maximum resources are available while the warehouse is running.",
        "This mode is effective for statically controlling the available compute resources, particularly if you have large numbers of concurrent\nuser sessions and/or queries and the numbers do not fluctuate significantly.",
        "This mode is enabled by specifying different values for maximum and minimum number of clusters. In this mode,\nSnowflake starts and stops clusters as needed to dynamically manage the load on the warehouse:",
        "As the number of concurrent user sessions and/or queries for the warehouse increases, and queries start to queue due to\ninsufficient resources, Snowflake automatically starts additional clusters, up to the maximum number defined for the warehouse.",
        "Similarly, as the load on the warehouse decreases, Snowflake automatically shuts down clusters to reduce the number of\nrunning clusters and, correspondingly, the number of credits used by the warehouse.",
        "To help control the usage of credits in Auto-scale mode, Snowflake provides a property, SCALING_POLICY, that determines the scaling policy\nto use when automatically starting or shutting down additional clusters. For more information, see Setting the scaling policy for a multi-cluster warehouse (in\nthis topic).",
        "Tip",
        "To create a multi-cluster warehouse, see Creating a multi-cluster warehouse (in this topic).",
        "Note the following:",
        "For multi-cluster warehouses, the maximum number of clusters in the Maximum Clusters field (Web Interface) or for the MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT property (SQL) must be greater than 1.",
        "For single-cluster warehouses, the maximum and minimum number of clusters must both be equal to 1.",
        "For auto-scale mode, the maximum number of clusters must be greater than the minimum number of clusters.",
        "For maximized mode, the maximum number of clusters must be equal to the minimum number of clusters.",
        "When determining the maximum and minimum number of clusters to use for a multi-cluster warehouse, start with Auto-scale mode and start\nsmall (e.g. maximum = 2 or 3, minimum = 1). As you track how your warehouse load fluctuates over time, you can increase the maximum and\nminimum number of clusters until you determine the numbers that best support the upper and lower boundaries of your user/query concurrency.",
        "The amount of compute resources in each cluster is determined by the warehouse size:",
        "The total number of clusters for the multi-cluster warehouse is calculated by multiplying the warehouse size by the maximum number of\nclusters. This also indicates the maximum number of credits consumed by the warehouse per full hour of usage (i.e. if\nall clusters run during the hour).",
        "For example, the maximum number of credits consumed per hour for a Medium-size multi-cluster warehouse with 3 clusters is 12 credits.",
        "If a multi-cluster warehouse is resized, the new size applies to all the clusters for the warehouse, including\nclusters that are currently running and any clusters that are started after the multi-cluster warehouse is resized.",
        "The actual number of credits consumed per hour depends on the number of clusters running during each hour that the warehouse\nis running. For more details, see Examples of multi-cluster credit usage (in this topic).",
        "With a standard, single-cluster warehouse, if your user/query load increases to the point where you need more compute resources:",
        "You must either increase the size of the warehouse or start additional warehouses and explicitly redirect the additional users/queries to\nthese warehouses.",
        "Then, when the resources are no longer needed, to conserve credits, you must manually downsize the larger warehouse or suspend the additional\nwarehouses.",
        "In contrast, a multi-cluster warehouse enables larger numbers of users to connect to the same size warehouse. In addition:",
        "In Auto-scale mode, a multi-cluster warehouse eliminates the need for resizing the warehouse or starting and stopping additional\nwarehouses to handle fluctuating workloads. Snowflake automatically starts and stops additional clusters as needed.",
        "In Maximized mode, you can control the capacity of the multi-cluster warehouse by increasing or decreasing the number of clusters as\nneeded.",
        "Tip",
        "Multi-cluster warehouses are best utilized for scaling resources to improve concurrency for users/queries. They are not as beneficial for\nimproving the performance of slow-running queries or data loading. For these types of operations, resizing the warehouse provides\nmore benefits.",
        "The following four examples illustrate credit usage for a multi-cluster warehouse. Refer to Virtual warehouse credit usage for\nthe number of credits billed per full hour by warehouse size.",
        "Note",
        "For the sake of simplicity, all these examples depict credit usage in increments of 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 15 minutes. In a real-world\nscenario, with per-second billing, the actual credit usage would contain fractional amounts, based on the number of seconds that each\ncluster runs.",
