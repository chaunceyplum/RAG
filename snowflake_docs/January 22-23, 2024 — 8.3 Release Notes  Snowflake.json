        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of network rules, which group related network identifiers\ninto logical units. When a Snowflake feature needs to restrict network traffic based on the origin or destination of a request,\nit can allow or block a network rule that contains the identifiers that should be permitted or denied.",

        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of enhanced security when using network policies to\nrestrict access to Snowflake.
