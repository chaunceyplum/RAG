        "Rotates a table by transforming columns into rows. UNPIVOT is a relational operator that accepts\ntwo columns (from a table or subquery), along with a list of columns, and generates a row for\neach column specified in the list. In a query, it is specified in the FROM clause after\nthe table name or subquery.",
        "UNPIVOT is not exactly the reverse of PIVOT because it cannot undo aggregations made by PIVOT.",
        "This operator can be used to transform a wide table (e.g. empid, jan_sales,\nfeb_sales, mar_sales) into a narrower table (e.g. empid, month,\nsales).",

        "Specifies whether to include or exclude rows with NULLs in the name_column:",

        "The name to assign to the generated column that will be populated with the names of the columns in the column list.",
        "The names of the columns in the source table or subquery that will be rotated into a single pivot column.\nThe column names will populate name_column, and the column values will populate value_column.",
        "The column_list can only contain literal column names, not a subquery.",
        "The columns in column_list must have exactly the same data type, with the following exceptions:",
        "The data types for text strings can be different lengths.",
        "If the columns contain text strings, different columns can use different data types for text. For example,\nthe list can include a VARCHAR column and a CHAR column.",

        "Unpivot the individual month columns to return a single sales value by month for each employee.",
        "The previous SELECT statement excludes NULLs by default. So, it does not include a row for appliances in February\nin the results. To include NULLs in the results, run the following SQL statement:",
        "This output includes a row for appliances in February.",
        "Instead of selecting all columns with *, you can include specific columns in the SELECT list and reference\nthe UNPIVOT value_column and name_column. The following example is similar to the previous\nexample, but it specifies the value_column sales and the name_column month in the\nSELECT list. The query excludes the empid column:",
