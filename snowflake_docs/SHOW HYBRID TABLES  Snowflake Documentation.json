        "The output returns hybrid table metadata and properties, ordered lexicographically by database, schema, and the name of the\nhybrid table (see Output in this topic for descriptions of the output columns). This is important to note if you wish to\nfilter the results using the provided filters.",

        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Optionally specifies the scope of the command, which determines whether the command lists records only for the\ncurrent/specified database or schema, or across your entire account.",
        "If you specify the keyword ACCOUNT, then the command retrieves records for all schemas in all databases\nof the current account.",

        "If there is a current database, then the command retrieves records for the specified schema in the current database.",

        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",

        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",

        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'AB' would return results (if any rows match the input strings).",
        "If an account (or database or schema) has a large number of hybrid tables, then searching the entire account (or database or\nschema) can consume a significant amount of compute resources.",
        "The command does not require a running warehouse to execute.",
        "The value for LIMIT rows cannot exceed 10000. If LIMIT rows is omitted, the command results in an error if the result set is larger than 10K rows.",
