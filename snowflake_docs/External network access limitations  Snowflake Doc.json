        "Currently, handlers written only in Java or Python may access network locations external to Snowflake.",
        "External network locations not on the public internet are not supported for external access. For example, locations behind a virtual\nprivate network (VPN) or virtual network (VNet) can\u2019t be reached from a UDF or procedure.",

        "Within handler code, you must access the secret API from the\nmain thread of the procedure or UDF. If your handler code forks a new thread and attempts to use a secrets API from it, you will see an\nerror such as the following:",
        "For example, the following Python code will generate an error:",
        "This feature is currently available to accounts on all AWS and Azure regions except Gov.",
