        "Updating a resource is used to redefine ingestion configurations for a particular resource.\nPUBLIC.UPDATE_RESOURCE procedure is the entry point from the UI or worksheet to update a resource.",
        "Calling this procedure requires the user has been assigned the ADMIN application role.",
        "The resource updating process consists of several phases. Several of which are customizable but include reasonable defaults.\nPhases are:",

        "whether given input data represent a valid resource ingestion configuration object",
        "whether a resource with given id and resourceId exists",
        "Custom validation is executed just after initial validation.\nIt is a part of the process which is designed to be customized with the connector-specific logic.",
        "By default, it invokes PUBLIC.UPDATE_RESOURCE_VALIDATE(resource_ingestion_definition_id VARCHAR, ingestion_configurations VARIANT),\nwhich returns 'response_code': 'OK'. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using\na UpdateResourceHandlerBuilder to provide custom implementation of the UpdateResourceValidator interface.",
        "If the custom validation returns error, the next steps will not be executed and given error response will be returned from UPDATE_RESOURCE procedure.",
        "Custom logic can be defined and executed before a resource is updated and rescheduled.",
        "By default, it invokes PUBLIC.PRE_UPDATE_RESOURCE(resource_ingestion_definition_id VARCHAR, ingestion_configurations VARIANT),\nwhich returns 'response_code': 'OK'. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using\na UpdateResourceHandlerBuilder to provide custom implementation of the PreUpdateResourceCallback interface.",

        "Within this step a new ingestion configurations are saved to STATE.RESOURCE_INGESTION_DEFINITION table for the resource\nwith a given resource_ingestion_definition_id.",
        "In this step, when a resource is enabled (enabled parameter equals true) all active ingestion processes (with\nstatuses SCHEDULED or IN_PROGRESS) with ingestion configurations that ids aren\u2019t included in the set of updated ingestion\nconfigurations are finished, which means that their status is switched to FINISHED.",
        "In this step, when a resource is enabled (enabled parameter equals true) new ingestion processes are created for\nupdated ingestion configurations that didn\u2019t exist in a previous ingestion configurations state for a given resource.",
        "Custom logic can be implemented and executed after resource ingestion configurations are updated.",
        "By default, it invokes PUBLIC.POST_UPDATE_RESOURCE(resource_ingestion_definition_id VARCHAR, ingestion_configurations VARIANT),\nwhich returns 'response_code': 'OK'. It can be overwritten through the SQL script or by using\na UpdateResourceHandlerBuilder to provide custom implementation of the PostUpdateResourceCallback interface.",
        "If custom logic returns an error, the given error response will be returned from UPDATE_RESOURCE procedure but the\nupdate of resource ingestion definition and ingestion processes will not be rolled back so if required, it should be\nhandled by the custom implementation.",
