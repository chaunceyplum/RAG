        "A Snowflake Data Clean Room is a cryptographically secure environment that allows\nentities to collaborate on sensitive data. It allows an entity to share its data with a collaborator while maintaining the privacy of the\ndata by tightly controlling what can be done with it.",
        "This tutorial leads you through the basic flow of using the web app to work with a Snowflake Data Clean Room.",
        "In this tutorial, you will learn how to do the following in the web app:",
        "Add a collaborator to your clean room environment.",
        "Create a clean room, including how to add data, specify join policies, define which type of analysis a collaborator can run on the data,\nand share the clean room with a collaborator.",
        "Install a clean room, including how to add data and define how this data is joined with the collaborator\u2019s data.",
        "Run an analysis, including how to create a new analysis based on what is allowed in the clean room and specify relevant parameters for\nthe analysis.",
        "Activate the results of the analysis.",
        "Clean room collaborators are either providers or consumers.",
        "A provider is the entity sharing their data with other clean room collaborators. They create and configure the clean room in order to\nmaintain the privacy of the data that they are sharing.",
        "A consumer is the entity using the clean room to interact with the shared data. The consumer can analyze and query the data within the\nclean room, including joining and enriching it with their own data.",
        "In this tutorial, you will act as both the provider and the consumer of the clean room.",
        "Before completing this tutorial, an administrator must set up the clean room environment and configure the Snowflake account associated\nwith it. This must be done for both the provider account and the consumer account. For details on how to perform these actions, see\nGet started with Snowflake Data Clean Rooms.",
        "To act as a consumer for the purposes of this tutorial, you must have access to a second Snowflake account associated with a second clean\nroom. This allows you to mimic how a consumer installs and uses the clean room. If you do not have a second account, you can still use this\ntutorial to learn how to create, configure, and share a clean room.",
        "If you are not the administrator who set up the clean rooms, a clean room administrator also needs to\nadd you as an user for the web app. You need to be an admin user in the clean room\nenvironment.",
