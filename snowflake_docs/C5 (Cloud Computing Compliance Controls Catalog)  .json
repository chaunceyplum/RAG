        "The Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalog (C5) is an audited standard establishing mandatory baselines for cloud security. The\nframework was created by the German Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, or BSI).\nC5 was initially created for government agencies and organizations that work with the government to ensure that security baselines are met\nby their cloud service providers (CSPs).  The private sector has also adopted this framework for evaluation of the security of their CSPs.\nThe framework is based on ISO 27001, CSA, and BSI\u2019s IT-Grundshutz catalogs. The certification can be obtained for either the Basic\nrequirements or Basic + Additional Criteria. Snowflake\u2019s C5 scope currently includes the Basic requirements.",
