        "For example, suppose that geography_expression_1 is POINT(1 1) and geography_expression_2 is\nLINESTRING(1 0, 1 2). In this case, geography_expression_1 is on the boundary of geography_expression_2\nbut is not a vertex of it.",
        "In this example, the expected output is POINT(1 1), but the actual output might be an empty geography (represented by NULL).",
        "To help to detect and work around these cases, one potential idea is to use ST_DWITHIN to\ndetermine if the minimum distance between the two input objects is 0. For example, you can check if a point lies on top of a\nLineString by checking if the minimum distance between the two objects is zero:",
