        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "For example, the following strings return different results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output)",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",

        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",

        "While Snowflake is provisioning a node, initially the value in the active_nodes and idle_nodes columns is 0, and the value in the target_nodes column is 1. (The value in the target_nodes column is the same as the value that you specified for the MIN_NODES parameter.) This indicates that there should be one node in the compute pool that Snowflake is provisioning.",
        "After Snowflake provisions one node, the value in the idle_nodes column is 1 (assuming that there are no services running). The value in the target_nodes column is still 1, indicating there should be one node in the compute pool.",
        "Example 2: Snowflake might try to add a node to an existing compute pool due to autoscaling or changes to the minimum number of nodes (through ALTER COMPUTE POOL \u2026 SET MIN_NODES).",
        "While Snowflake is provisioning a node, the value in the state column is resizing. To determine how many nodes Snowflake is adding, check the value in the target_nodes column.",
        "For example, suppose that the value in the, active_nodes column is 1, the value in the idle_nodes column is 0, and you resize the compute pool by updating the MIN_NODES property from 1 to 2. In this case, the value in the target_nodes column is 2 (the number of nodes that should be in the compute pool). From this, you can infer that Snowflake is provisioning one additional node.",
