        "The Hausdorff distance indicates how similar the two objects are. Two objects are considered to be similar if each point in\none object is close to a point in the other object. The Hausdorff distance is the greatest distance between a point in one\nobject and a point in the other object.",

        "The distance between the farthest points in a and c (point 0 1 and point 0 3) is greater than the distance\nbetween the farthest points in a and b (point 1 0 and point 2 0).",
        "As a result, the value returned by ST_HAUSDORFFDISTANCE is smaller for a and c. This indicates that a and c\nare more similar than a and b.",
