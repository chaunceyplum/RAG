        "In syntax and code descriptions, angle brackets (< >), square brackets ([ ]), curly braces ({ }), and vertical bars (|) are used for notational purposes only. To\navoid syntax errors, do not include them when entering a command or writing code.",
        "However, brackets and braces have specific meanings in JSON and XML, and therefore must be included when working with JSON or XML documents/data.",

        "ITEM , ITEM",
        "All-uppercase indicates a Snowflake SQL command, keyword, parameter name, or function name.",

        "<item> , item",
        "Angle brackets and italics indicate identifiers, parameters, or arguments that are provided by users.",
        "( item1 item2 ... )",
        "Parentheses are used in SQL to group parameters or arguments.",
        "They are required when entering a command (i.e. they must be typed exactly as they appear).",
        "{ item1 item2 ... }",
        "Curly braces indicate groupings of identifiers, parameters, or arguments.",
        "Curly braces are also used with vertical bars to delimit choices when more than one choice is available.",
        "In both of those cases, the curly braces should not be entered.",
        "[ ITEM ] ,\n[ item1 item2 ... ]",
        "Square brackets indicate optional parts of a statement. They should not be entered.",
        "In many cases, items in the square brackets are optional because default values are provided.",
        "|",
        "A vertical bar indicates a choice between two or more items or values, usually within square brackets or curly braces. The square brackets or curly braces should\nnot be entered.",

        "The previous item can be repeated an indefinite number of times.",
        "In the following, the keyword WORK is optional:",
        "Therefore, either of the following are valid:",
        "In the following, you can use either the keyword WORK or the keyword TRANSACTION. You must not use both. You can omit both.",
        "Therefore, any of the following are valid:",
        "The following shows the syntax of a function call that accepts one argument. The parentheses are required.\nThe <function_name>, <argument_name>, and <data_type> should be replaced with the actual names:",
        "Therefore, the following is valid:",
        "The following shows a function that requires at least one argument and accepts optional additional arguments.",
        "Therefore, the following are valid:",
