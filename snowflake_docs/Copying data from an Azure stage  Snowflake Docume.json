        "Loading data requires a warehouse. If you\u2019re using a warehouse that is not configured to auto resume, execute ALTER WAREHOUSE to resume the warehouse. Note that starting the warehouse could take up to five minutes.",
        "The following example loads data from files in the named my_azure_stage stage created in Creating an Azure stage. Using pattern matching, the statement only loads files whose names start with the string sales:",
        "Note that file format options are not specified because a named file format was included in the stage definition.",

        "The following ad hoc example loads data from all files in the Azure container. The COPY command specifies file format options instead of referencing a named file format. This example loads CSV files with a pipe (|) field delimiter. The COPY command skips the first line in the data files:",
        "Before loading your data, you can validate that the data in the uploaded files will load correctly.",
        "To validate data in an uploaded file, execute COPY INTO <table> in validation mode using the VALIDATION_MODE parameter. The VALIDATION_MODE parameter returns errors that it encounters in the file. You can then modify the data in the file to ensure it loads without error.",
        "In addition, COPY INTO <table> provides the ON_ERROR copy option to specify an action to perform if errors are encountered in a file during loading.",
        "Note",
        "While Azure storage accounts support the MD5 File Validation feature, Azure doesn\u2019t calculate MD5 hash values for files larger than 100 MB. For more information, see MD5 hash calculation for large files.",
        "Snowflake retains historical data for COPY INTO commands executed within the previous 14 days. The metadata can be used to monitor and\nmanage the loading process, including deleting files after upload completes:",
