        "This example shows that the COLLATE function does not change the string. The copied string in the third column is\nlowercase, which is the same as the original string in the first column. However, the collation specification\nof the value returned by COLLATE has changed from es to es-ci.",
        "This example shows that although the value returned by COLLATE is still a lowercase string, the ci collation\nspecifier is used when comparing that string to another string:",
