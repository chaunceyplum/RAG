        "Snowflake uses an improved version of the t-Digest algorithm, a space and time efficient way of estimating approximate percentile\nvalues in data sets.",
        "Snowflake provides an improved version of an implementation of the\nt-Digest algorithm papers by Dunning and Ertl.\nIt has been implemented through the\nAPPROX_PERCENTILE family of functions.",
        "As documented, the algorithm has a constant relative error. Note that the algorithm has substantial empirical support, but no rigorous proof of any accuracy guarantees.",
        "The following Aggregate functions are provided for using t-Digest to approximate percentile values:",
        "APPROX_PERCENTILE: Returns an approximation of the desired percentile value.",
        "APPROX_PERCENTILE_ACCUMULATE: Skips the final estimation step and, instead, returns the intermediate t-Digest state at the end of an aggregation.",
        "APPROX_PERCENTILE_COMBINE: Combines (i.e. merges) multiple input states into a single output state.",
        "APPROX_PERCENTILE_ESTIMATE: Computes a percentile estimate of a t-Digest state produced by APPROX_PERCENTILE_ACCUMULATE or APPROX_PERCENTILE_COMBINE.",
        "The estimation uses a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the input.",
        "The t-Digest state is independent from the percentile value. This enables calculating the t-Digest state once, and then querying the state for multiple percentile values.",
