        "Events that create a warehouse, change the size of the warehouse or the number of clusters, or suspend a warehouse, are not atomic\noperations. This means that some small amount of time is required for these operations to fully complete.",
        "For example, if a warehouse is suspended using an ALTER WAREHOUSE \u2026 SUSPEND statement, any queries that are currently executing on the\nwarehouse must complete (or time out) before it can be suspended. In some cases, multiple warehouse events might be in-flight (for example,\nresize and suspend). When all warehouse events have completed, the warehouse is in a consistent state.",

        "If an event is logged with the STARTED state, it is never logged with the COMPLETED state. Instead, an event logged with the STARTED\nstate is always followed by a subsequent WAREHOUSE_CONSISTENT event. If multiple warehouse events are logged with the STARTED event\nstate, those events coalesce to the same WAREHOUSE_CONSISTENT event.",
        "If an event is logged with the COMPLETED state, no subsequent WAREHOUSE_CONSISTENT event follows unless another pending\nevent is logged with a STARTED state.",
