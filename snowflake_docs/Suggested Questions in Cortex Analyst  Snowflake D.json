        "The Suggested Questions feature in Cortex Analyst provides relevant suggestions for questions your users can ask while\ninteracting with your Cortex Analyst-powered conversational app. Use this feature to help your users get started.",
        "Cortex Analyst operates in three modes depending on the configuration of your semantic model.",
        "Generates questions using Large Language Models (Default mode without Verified Query Repository)",
        "When your semantic model doesn\u2019t include a Verified Query Repository (VQR), Cortex Analyst uses the\nunderlying Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate up to three suggested questions.\nNote that these questions may not always be answerable; for instance, the system might suggest a question that\nyields no results.",
        "Suggests questions from the Verified Query Repository (Default mode with VQR)",
        "If your semantic model has a Verified Query Repository (VQR)\ndefined, Cortex Analyst returns up to five suggested questions from the VQR. These questions are selected based on their similarity to\nthe user\u2019s input. For example, if a user asks, What questions can I ask about revenue?, Cortex Analyst returns up to 5 questions\nthat are most likely about revenue from the VQR repository that are most likely answerable.",
        "Returns onboarding questions configured in the semantic model (Customizable Mode with VQR)",
        "For more control over which questions are displayed, you can use the new use_as_onboarding_question flag in your VQR configuration.",
        "When this flag is set to true, Cortex Analyst will return all questions marked as onboarding questions, regardless of their\nsimilarity to the user\u2019s input.",
        "This feature is helpful if you want to present a full set of predefined, answerable questions for users, such as in an\nonboarding experience. If you flag more than 5 questions, all of the flagged questions are returned in the response.",
        "To define onboarding questions, you need to mark specific verified queries in the\nsemantic model with the use_as_onboarding_question flag. The example below shows how to set this up:",
