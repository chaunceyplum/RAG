        "With Snowpipe\u2019s serverless compute model, users can initiate any size load without managing a virtual warehouse. Instead, Snowflake provides and manages the compute resources, automatically growing or shrinking capacity based on the current Snowpipe load. Accounts are charged based on their actual compute resource usage; in contrast with customer-managed virtual warehouses, which consume credits when active, and may sit idle or be overutilized.",
        "Snowflake tracks the resource consumption of loads for all pipes in an account, with per-second/per-core granularity, as Snowpipe actively queues and processes data files. Per-core refers to\nthe physical CPU cores in a compute server. The utilization recorded is then translated into familiar Snowflake credits, which are listed on the bill for your account.",
        "Note",
        "Using a multi-threaded client application enables submitting data files in parallel, which initiates additional servers and loads the data in less time. However, the actual overall compute time required would be identical to using a single-threaded client application, just spread out over more internal Snowpipe servers.",
        "Decisions with regard to data file size and staging frequency impact the cost and performance of Snowpipe. For recommended best practices, see Continuous data loads (i.e. Snowpipe) and file sizing.",
        "In addition to resource consumption, an overhead is included in the utilization costs charged for Snowpipe. This overhead is charged\nregardless if the event notifications or REST API calls resulted in data loaded. This overhead charge appears as Snowpipe charges in your\nbilling statement.",
        "To learn how many credits per compute-hour are consumed by Snowpipe, refer to the \u201cServerless\nFeature Credit Table\u201d in the Snowflake Service Consumption Table.",
        "Given the number of factors that can differentiate Snowpipe loads, it is very difficult for Snowflake to provide sample costs. File formats and sizes, and the complexity of COPY statements (including SELECT statement used for transformations), all impact the resource consumption and file overhead charged for a Snowpipe load.",
        "We suggest that you experiment by performing a typical set of loads to estimate future charges.",
        "Account administrators (users with the ACCOUNTADMIN role) or users with a role granted the MONITOR USAGE global privilege can use Snowsight, the Classic Console, or SQL to view the credits billed to your Snowflake account within a specified date range.",
        "Occasionally, the data compaction and maintenance process can consume Snowflake credits. For example, the returned results might show that you consumed credits with 0 BYTES_INSERTED and 0 FILES_INSERTED. This means that your data is not being loaded, but the data compaction and maintenance process has consumed some credits.",

        "Query: Snowpipe cost history (by day, by object)",
        "This query provides a full list of pipes and the volume of credits consumed via the service over the last 30 days, broken out by day.\nAny irregularities in the credit consumption or consistently high consumption are flags for additional investigation.",
        "Query: Snowpipe History & m-day average",
        "This query shows the average daily credits consumed by Snowpipe grouped by week over the last year. It can help identify anomalies in\ndaily averages over the year so you can investigate spikes or unexpected changes in consumption.",
        "Note",
        "Resource monitors provide control over virtual warehouse credit usage; however, you cannot use them to control\ncredit usage for the Snowflake-provided warehouses, including the  SNOWPIPE warehouse.",
