        "HashiCorp Terraform is an open source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to dynamically build, change, and version infrastructure resources. You use the Terraform language to create configuration files that describe the configuration you want. Terraform compares your configuration to the current state and then generates a plan to create new resources or update and delete existing resources. The plan runs as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which allows Terraform to understand and handle dependencies between resources.",
