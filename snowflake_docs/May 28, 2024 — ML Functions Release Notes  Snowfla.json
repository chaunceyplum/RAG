        "You can now call the Forecast and\nDetect Anomalies ML Functions directly in the FROM clause\nof a SELECT statement. You can call methods like <model_name>!DETECT_ANOMALIES,\n<model_name>!FORECAST, and\n<model_name>!SHOW_EVALUATION_METRICS in the FROM clause.",
        "You can use this technique to simplify the SQL statements for saving results to a table. For example, rather than using the\nSQLID Snowflake Scripting variable with the\nRESULT_SCAN function to create a table containing these results:",
        "you can use a query that directly selects from the results of calling the methods:",
        "As shown in the example above, when calling the method, omit the CALL command. Instead, put the call\nin parentheses, preceded by the TABLE keyword.",
        "For details, see Selecting columns from SQL class instance methods that return tabular data.",
        "In addition, as announced earlier and shown in the example above,\nyou can use the TABLE keyword (rather than calling SYSTEM$REFERENCE) to create a reference to\npass in to the method.",
