        "Optionally specifies the scope of the command, which determines whether the command lists records only for the current/specified\ndatabase or schema, or across your entire account:",
        "The APPLICATION and APPLICATION PACKAGE keywords are not required, but they specify the scope for the named Snowflake Native App.",
        "The DATABASE or SCHEMA keyword is not required; you can set the scope by specifying only the database or schema name.\nLikewise, the database or schema name is not required if the session currently has a database in use:",
        "If DATABASE or SCHEMA is specified without a name and the session does not currently have a database in use, the\nparameter has no effect on the output.",
        "If SCHEMA is specified with a name and the session does not currently have a database in use, the schema name must\nbe fully qualified with the database name (e.g. testdb.testschema).",

        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",

        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output)",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",

        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",

        "The value for LIMIT rows cannot exceed 10000. If LIMIT rows is omitted, the command results in an error if the result set is larger than 10K rows.",
        "To view results for which more than 10K records exist, either include LIMIT rows or query the corresponding view in the Snowflake Information Schema.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",
        "By design, the command output includes secure views, but does not provide certain information about these views unless you are using\nthe role that has ownership of the view. To view details for secure views, you must use the role that owns the view or use the\nVIEWS view in the Information Schema.",
        "The output of this command might include objects with names like SN_TEMP_OBJECT_<n> (where <n> is a number). These are\ntemporary objects that are created by the Snowpark library on behalf of the user.",
