        "To work with Document AI:",
        "Prepare a warehouse, database, and schema to be used with Document AI.",
        "Snowflake recommends creating a separate warehouse for Document AI to help you track costs; for example, the doc_ai_wh X-Small warehouse.\nFor more information, see Determining optimal warehouse size for Document AI.",

        "To provide a user full access to Document AI, you must do all of the following:",
        "Grant the SNOWFLAKE.DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_CREATOR database role to an account role, and then grant the account role to users.",
        "Grant the privileges to prepare a Document AI model build.",
