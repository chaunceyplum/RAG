        "Feature \u2014 Generally Available",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework is generally available on supported cloud platforms. For additional information, see\nSupport for private connectivity, VPS, and government regions.",
        "This topic provides an overview of the security requirements and guidelines\nwhen developing a Snowflake Native App. It also provides general information about automated\nsecurity scan and review process when publishing an app to consumers.",
        "Caution",
        "It is your responsibility to ensure that no personal data, sensitive data,\nexport-controlled data, or other regulated data is entered into any files included\nin your application package.",
        "The Snowflake Native App Framework provides security requirements and best practices that providers must follow when\ndeveloping a Snowflake Native App. For security requirements and best practices for an app, see\nSecurity requirements and best practices for a Snowflake Native App. For security requirements for an app with containers, see\nSecure a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services.",
        "To publish an app to consumers, either as a private listing or on the Snowflake Marketplace,\nSnowflake implements a security review process that requires a security scan of the components\nof an app. If an app does not pass the automated security review, a manual review occurs.",
        "All apps that are published to consumers must pass this security review.",
        "The following are some of the possible security risks that can occur when running an app:",
        "Data exfiltration:",
        "Malicious apps could copy consumer data to external functions or logs.",
        "Compute abuse:",
        "Apps could perform unauthorized tasks, such as cryptomining, at the consumer\u2019s expense.",
        "Ransomware",
        "Apps could encrypt or corrupt consumer data, demanding payment for restoration.",
        "Privilege escalation:",
        "Apps could attempt to gain unauthorized permissions within the consumer\u2019s account.",
        "To mitigate these and other possible security risks, the Snowflake Native App Framework uses a security review to evaluate\nan app for security risks and to ensure security best practices.",
        "To mitigate potential security risks, Snowflake uses the Native App Anti-Abuse Pipeline Service (NAAAPS).\nThis service automatically scans all new app versions using various tools to determine if an app can\nbe distributed to consumers.",
        "This automated security review occurs when a new version or patch of an app is created. This review\nperforms the following:",
        "Copies the app to a dedicated Snowflake account used to scan apps.",
        "Scans the files associated with the app and updates the security review status.",
        "Auto-approves the app or initiates a manual review of the app.",
        "Snowflake sends out automatic rejection notifications to reduce the time a provider must wait for a\nresponse. During the manual review process, an app can be approved or rejected.",
        "The automated security review uses the following scanners and tools to perform the\nfollowing to analyze different components of an app:",
        "Scan code for bugs, anti-patterns, and security vulnerabilities in code.",
        "Scan code for malware.",
        "Identify vulnerabilities in app dependencies.",
        "The processes help detect various security issues, such as data exfiltration, ransomware, compute\nabuse, privilege escalation, and dynamic code execution.",
        "All apps must conform to the security requirements outlined in the Security requirements and best practices for a Snowflake Native App.",
        "Note",
        "Security requirements are subject to change as Snowflake continues to monitor new potential risks.",
        "For information about additional security requirements for a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services see\nSecure a Snowflake Native App with Snowpark Container Services.",
        "When publishing an app to the Snowflake Marketplace, providers must consider additional requirements\nand best practices. See Guidelines for publishing an app to the Snowflake Marketplace.",
        "Snowflake\u2019s approach to addressing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in a Snowflake Native App\nis based on our CVE Evaluation Criteria, a policy that establishes clear and objective criteria\nfor evaluating and prioritizing CVEs based on their risk profile.",
        "The policy aims to balance the mitigation of critical security risks with the effort required to\naddress less severe vulnerabilities. It applies to all apps undergoing security review\nand is enforced to ensure only apps meeting the defined criteria are approved for publishing\nin Snowflake\u2019s data cloud environment.",
        "See Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) considerations for additional information.",
        "When configuring a Snowflake Native App to be shared externally, providers automatically share the code in app\nwith Snowflake for scanning. The following table maps the NAAAPS scanning regions to the corresponding\nprovider regions:",
