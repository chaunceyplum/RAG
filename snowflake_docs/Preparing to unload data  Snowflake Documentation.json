        "In addition, to simplify data unloading, Snowflake supports creating named file formats, which are database objects that encapsulate all of the required\nformat information. Named file formats can then be used as input in all the same places where you can specify individual file format options, thereby\nhelping to streamline the data unloading process for similarly-formatted data.",
        "Named file formats are optional, but are recommended when you plan to regularly unload similarly-formatted data.",
