        "When this behavior change bundle is enabled, providers must indicate in the manifest that a\nSnowflake Native App requires a compute pool with a graphics processing unit (GPU).",
        "Providers can configure a Snowflake Native App to use a graphic processing unit (GPU) by setting the INSTANCE_FAMILY\nparameter of the CREATE COMPUTE POOL in the setup script of the app.",
        "In addition to setting the INSTANCE_FAMILY parameter when creating a compute pool,\nproviders must also add the uses_gpu property to the manifest file of the app. This property is used during the automated\nsecurity scan and to enable the app to create compute pools that use GPUs.",
