        "An organization administrator (i.e. a user granted the ORGADMIN role) can rename an account.",
        "When an account is renamed, Snowflake creates a new account URL that is used to access the account.\nDuring the renaming, the administrator can accept the default to save the original account URL so users can continue to use it, or they\ncan delete the original URL to force users to use the new URL. Saved URLs can be deleted at a later time. You cannot save the original URL for a reader account.",
        "Organization administrators cannot rename an account while they are logged in to it, so they must log in to a different account before\nexecuting the renaming command. If your organization consists of a single account that needs to be renamed, contact Snowflake Support.",
