        "This topic provides an introduction to what Snowflake Copilot is and how to use it in your data analysis workflow. The examples in this topic\nuses worksheets but the same steps apply to using Snowflake Copilot in Snowflake Notebooks.",
        "Note",
        "Support for this feature is available to accounts in the following regions:",
        "AWS us-east-1",
        "AWS us-west-2",
        "AWS eu-central-1",
        "Azure eastus2",
        "Snowflake Copilot is an LLM-powered assistant that simplifies data analysis while maintaining robust data governance, and seamlessly integrates\ninto your existing Snowflake workflow.",
        "Snowflake Copilot is powered by a model fine-tuned by Snowflake that runs securely inside Snowflake Cortex,\nSnowflake\u2019s intelligent, fully managed AI service. This approach means that your enterprise data and metadata always stay securely inside\nSnowflake. Snowflake Copilot also fully respects RBAC and provides suggestions based only on the datasets that you can access.",
        "Snowflake Copilot uses natural language requests to enable data analysis from start to finish. To start, Copilot can help answer questions\nabout how your data is structured and guide you in exploring a new dataset. You can then ask Copilot to generate and refine SQL queries to\nextract useful information from your data. Snowflake Copilot can even help improve your SQL query by recommending optimizations or suggesting\nfixes for possible issues.",
        "Snowflake Copilot can also help improve your SQL fluency or understanding of Snowflake features. Ask questions about how to perform a task in\nSnowflake and Copilot will return answers based on the Snowflake documentation.",
        "You can interact with Copilot in SQL Worksheets and Snowflake Notebooks in Snowsight. Using the Copilot panel, you can enter a question,\nand Snowflake Copilot will reply with an answer. You can run suggested SQL queries in your worksheet or notebook.",
        "The COPILOT_USER database role in the SNOWFLAKE database includes the privileges that allow users to use Snowflake Copilot features. By default,\nthe COPILOT_USER role is granted to the PUBLIC role. The PUBLIC role is automatically granted\nto all users and roles, so this allows all users in your account to use Snowflake Copilot features.",
        "Users with this privilege will see Ask Copilot in the lower-right corner of their worksheet or notebook and can use the panel\nto interact with Snowflake Copilot.",
        "If you don\u2019t want all users to have this privilege, you can revoke access to the PUBLIC role and grant access to specific roles.",
        "To revoke the COPILOT_USER database role from the PUBLIC role, run the following command using the ACCOUNTADMIN role:",
        "A user without this role will not see Ask Copilot in the lower-right corner of their worksheet or notebook. You can switch your\nactive role in the navigation menu on the left to switch to a role that has access to Copilot to see the Ask Copilot menu again.\nFor details, see Switch your active role.",
        "You can then selectively provide access to specific roles. The SNOWFLAKE.COPILOT_USER database role cannot be granted directly to a user.\nFor more information, see Using SNOWFLAKE database roles. A user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role can grant this role to a custom role\nin order to allow users to access Snowflake Copilot features. In the following example, use the ACCOUNTADMIN role and grant the user\nsome_user the COPILOT_USER database role via the account role copilot_access_role, which you create for this purpose.",
        "You can also grant access to Snowflake Copilot through existing roles commonly used by specific groups of\nusers. (See User roles.) For example, if you have created an analyst role that is used\nas a default role by analysts in your organization, you can easily grant these users access to Snowflake Copilot\nwith a single GRANT statement.",
        "Explore your data by asking open-ended questions to learn about the structure and nuances of a new dataset.",
        "Generate SQL queries with questions in plain English.",
        "Try out the SQL query suggested by Snowflake Copilot with the click of a button. You can also edit the query\nbefore running it.",
        "Build complex queries through a conversation with Snowflake Copilot by asking follow-up questions to refine the suggested SQL query and\ndig deeper into the analysis.",
        "Learn about Snowflake by asking questions about Snowflake concepts, capabilities, and features.",
        "Improve your queries by asking Snowflake Copilot to help you assess query efficiency, find optimizations, or explain what the query does.",
        "Provide feedback (thumbs up or thumbs down) on each response from Snowflake Copilot, which will be used to improve the product.",
        "Add custom instructions such as a set of preferences or specific business knowledge for Snowflake Copilot to consider\nwhen generating responses.",
        "Limited language support: Today, only English and SQL are supported.",
        "No access to your data: Snowflake Copilot does not have access to the data inside your tables. If you want to\nfilter on a particular value of a column, you should provide that value. For example, if you ask Snowflake Copilot to return all rows with a\ncolumn A value equal to \u201cX\u201d, you should provide the value \u201cX\u201d in your request. See the\nConstruct and run a SQL Statement example.",
        "Cross database or schema queries are not supported: You can work around this by creating and using views that join data from\ndifferent schemas and databases.",
        "Delayed response: Snowflake Copilot might take a second to complete a response, depending on the length of the response provided.",
        "SQL suggestions may not always work: Snowflake Copilot may sometimes suggest queries that contain invalid SQL syntax or non-existent\ntables or columns. Please provide feedback using the thumbs up or thumbs down buttons for the particular response. This feedback helps us\nimprove this feature.",
        "Delay in detecting new databases, schemas, and tables: It may take up to 3-4 hours for Snowflake Copilot to recognize newly created\ndatabases, schemas, and tables.",
        "Limited number of tables and columns considered: To generate a response, Snowflake Copilot first searches for\ntables and columns most relevant for your request. The search results are then ranked by relevancy and only the top 10 tables and top\n10 columns from each of those tables in the results are considered when generating a response.",
        "Snowflake Copilot is ready to use with no additional setup. Remember the following points when using Snowflake Copilot:",
        "Each chat session with Snowflake Copilot is associated with a particular worksheet or notebook. Opening a new worksheet or notebook opens a\nnew chat session.",
        "You must have a database and schema in use during your session to use Snowflake Copilot. Copilot uses them to generate relevant responses.",
        "Snowflake Copilot uses the names of your databases, schemas, tables, and columns and also the data types of your columns to determine what\ndata is available to query.",
        "If Snowflake Copilot cannot answer your question based on the selected database and schema, it may try to use other ways to answer, such\nas the Snowflake documentation or general SQL knowledge. If you get an unexpected response, you can leave feedback using the\nthumbs up and thumbs down buttons.",
        "If you need to refer to a table name or a column name in your question, prefix the name with @. Referring to specific tables\nand columns can help Snowflake Copilot provide more accurate responses.",
        "For optimal performance, use meaningful names for databases, schemas, tables, and columns, and ensure that columns are assigned the\nappropriate data type.",
        "Follow these steps to start using Snowflake Copilot:",
        "Create a new worksheet or open an existing worksheet.",
        "Select Ask Copilot in the lower-right corner of the worksheet.\nThe Snowflake Copilot panel opens on the right side of the worksheet.",
        "Make sure a database and a schema are selected for the current worksheet. If not, you can select them by using either\nthe selector on the top of the worksheet or the selector below the Snowflake Copilot message box.",
        "In the message box, type in your question and then select the send icon or press Enter to submit it. Snowflake Copilot provides a\nresponse in the panel.",
        "If the response from Snowflake Copilot includes SQL statements:",
        "Select Run to run the query. This adds the query to your worksheet and runs it.",
        "Select Add to edit the query before running it. This adds the query to your worksheet.",
        "Snowflake Copilot accepts custom instructions that let you customize how it responds. When enabled,\nthese instructions are used to enhance the prompt that\u2019s sent to the model behind Snowflake Copilot and are considered by\nCopilot when it\u2019s generating new responses. Custom instructions can include directions to use a specific tone or respond in a certain way,\npreferences on how to write SQL, or additional information about the data to consider.",
        "Remember the following when adding custom instructions:",
        "There is a 2,000 character limit for custom instructions.",
