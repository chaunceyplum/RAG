        "In Snowflake SQL statements, in addition to referring to objects by name (see Identifier requirements), you can\nalso use a string literal, session variable, bind variable, or\nSnowflake Scripting variable to refer to an object. For example, you can\nuse a session variable that is set to the name of a table in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement. To use an object name\nspecified in a literal or variable, use IDENTIFIER().",
        "Using IDENTIFIER() to identify database objects is a best practice because can it can make\ncode more reusable and help to prevent SQL injection risks.",
        "String identifying the name of the object:",
        "The string must either be enclosed by single quotes ('name') or start with a dollar sign ($name).",
        "The string literal can be a fully-qualified object name (e.g. 'db_name.schema_name.object_name' or $db_name.schema_name.object_name).",
        "A SQL variable that has been set for the session.",
        "A bind variable, in the form of ? or :variable, which can be used by clients/programmatic interfaces that support binding (JDBC, ODBC, Python, etc.).",
        "A Snowflake Scripting variable that has been set.",
        "You can use literals and variables (session or bind) in some cases when you need to identify an object by name (queries, DML,\nDDL, etc.).",
        "You can use bind variables for object identifiers and bind variables for values in the same query.",
        "In a FROM clause, you can use\nTABLE( { string_literal | session_variable | bind_variable | snowflake_scripting_variable } ) as a synonym for\nIDENTIFIER( { string_literal | session_variable | bind_variable | snowflake_scripting_variable } ).",
        "Although IDENTIFIER() uses the syntax of a function, it is not a true function and is not returned by commands such as\nSHOW FUNCTIONS.",
        "The following examples use IDENTIFIER().",
        "These examples show how to refer to an object when a string literal contains the\nobject identifier.",
