        "A warehouse of size X-Small is usually a sufficient size for small operational workloads.\nIn order to achieve higher concurrency and throughput on short running\noperational queries, it is recommended that you increase the compute node count by using a\nmulti-cluster warehouse rather than\nincreasing compute resources with a larger warehouse.",
        "If your workload has variable throughput patterns, you can enable autoscaling to\nreduce consumption when demand is lower. Set the scaling policy to Standard\nrather than Economy for the best performance and efficiency on workloads\nrequiring high throughput or low latency. For more information, see\nSetting the scaling policy for a multi-cluster warehouse.",
        "If possible, it is best to isolate separate workloads in separate\nwarehouses so that they can scale independently. If you\nhave a mixed hybrid workload with operational and analytical components, it is\nbeneficial to separate the operational and analytical components in separate\nwarehouses. If you cannot separate them and must execute them together on the\nsame warehouse, then choose the warehouse size based on the analytical query\nlatency requirements and choose the multi-cluster node count based on what is\nrequired to support your workload\u2019s throughput.",
        "The performance of hybrid tables can be impacted by throttling even in a case\nwhere virtual warehouse compute usage is not high. To monitor your usage and\ndetermine whether a hybrid table is being throttled, see the example in\nAGGREGATE_QUERY_HISTORY view. You can also retrieve\nthe number of throttled hybrid table requests from\nthe HYBRID_TABLE_REQUESTS_THROTTLED_COUNT column.",
