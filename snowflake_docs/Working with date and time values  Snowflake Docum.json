        "Date and time calculations are among the most widely used and most critical computations in analytics and data mining. This topic provides practical examples of common date and time queries\nand calculations.",
        "This section provides examples for loading date and timestamp values, and describes considerations related to\ntime zones when loading these values.",
        "In the following example, the TIMESTAMP_TYPE_MAPPING parameter is set to TIMESTAMP_LTZ (local time zone).\nThe TIMEZONE parameter is set to America/Chicago time. If some incoming timestamps don\u2019t have a specified time zone,\nthen Snowflake loads those strings assuming the timestamps represent local time in the time zone set for the TIMEZONE parameter.",
        "In the following example, the TIMESTAMP_TYPE_MAPPING parameter is set to TIMESTAMP_LTZ (local time zone).\nThe TIMEZONE parameter is set to America/Chicago time. If some incoming timestamps have a different\ntime zone specified, Snowflake loads the string in America/Chicago time.",
        "In the following example, a set of timestamp values is stored with no time zone data. The timestamps are loaded in UTC time and converted to other time zones:",
        "This example inserts values into a DATE column.",
        "The TO_DATE function accepts TIMESTAMP values and strings in TIMESTAMP format, but discards the time information\n(hours, minutes, and so on).",
        "If you insert a DATE that was defined with only a time, then the default date is January 1, 1970.",
        "When you retrieve DATE values, you can format them as TIMESTAMP values:",
        "Get the current date as a DATE value:",

        "Get the current day of the week as a number using the EXTRACT function:",
        "Note",
        "The dayofweek_iso part follows the ISO-8601 data elements and interchange formats standard.\nThe function returns the day of the week as an integer value in the range 1-7, where 1 represents Monday.",
        "For compatibility with some other systems, the dayofweek part follows the UNIX standard.\nThe function returns the day of the week as an integer value in the range 0-6, where 0 represents Sunday.",
        "You can get the current day of the week as a string using the TO_VARCHAR\nor DECODE function.",
        "Run a query that returns the short English name (for example, Sun, Mon, and so on) for the current date:",
        "Run a query that returns the explicitly-provided weekday names for the current date:",

        "Get the last day of the current month as a DATE value using the DATEADD and DATE_TRUNC functions:",
        "For an alternative option, the following example uses DATE_TRUNC to retrieve the beginning of the current month, adds one month to retrieve\nthe beginning of the next month, and then subtracts one day to determine the last day of the current month.",
        "Get the last day of the previous month as a DATE value:",

        "Note",
        "In the above query, the 1 value in 7 + 1 translates to Monday. To retrieve the date for the first Tuesday,\nWednesday, and so on, substitute 2, 3, and so on, respectively, through 7 for Sunday.",

        "Add two minutes to the current date and time:",
        "Add two seconds to the current date and time:",
        "In most use cases, Snowflake correctly handles date and timestamp values formatted as strings. In certain cases,\nsuch as string-based comparisons or when a result depends on a different timestamp format from the format set in\nthe session parameters, we recommend explicitly converting values to the desired format to avoid unexpected results.",
        "For example, without explicit casting, comparing string values produces string-based results:",
