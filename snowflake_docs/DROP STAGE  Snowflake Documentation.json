        "For an internal stage, all of the files in the stage are purged from Snowflake, regardless of their load status. This\nprevents the files from continuing to using storage and, consequently, accruing storage charges. However, this also means that the\nstaged files cannot be recovered after a stage is dropped.",
        "For an external stage, only the stage itself is dropped; any data files in the referenced external location (Amazon S3, Google Cloud\nStorage, or Microsoft Azure) are not removed.",
