        "This behavior change is in the 2024_06 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "The behavior of the SHOW <objects> command is as follows:",
        "The role used to execute the command requires the USAGE privilege on the object to see the objects.",
        "For example, the SHOW SCHEMAS command requires the USAGE privilege on the schema.",
        "Other privileges on the schema, such as MODIFY, are not sufficient to see the table objects in the schema.",
        "The role used to execute the command can be granted any privilege on the object to see the objects in the output.",
        "For example, if the role used to execute the SHOW SCHEMAS command is granted the MODIFY privilege on the schema, the role can see those\nschemas in the output.",
        "Consequently, the output of the SHOW command might return more objects than before the change depending on the grants to the role that\nexecutes the command.",
        "These changes apply to all SHOW commands.",
