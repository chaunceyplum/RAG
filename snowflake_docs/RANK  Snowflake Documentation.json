        "Window functions (Ranking)",
        "Returns the rank of a value within an ordered group of values.",
        "The rank value starts at 1 and continues up sequentially.",
        "If two values are the same, they have the same rank.",
        "For detailed window_frame syntax, see Window function syntax and usage.",
        "The function itself takes no arguments because it returns the rank (relative position) of the current row\nwithin the window, which is ordered by <expr2>. The ordering of the window determines the rank, so there\nis no need to pass an additional parameter to the RANK function.",
        "expr1\nThe column or expression to partition the window by.",
        "For example, suppose that within each state or province, you want to rank\nfarmers in order by the amount of corn they produced. In this case, you\npartition by state.",
        "If you want only a single group (e.g. you want to rank all farmers in the U.S.\nregardless of which state they live in), then omit the PARTITION BY clause.",
        "expr2\nThe column or expression to order (rank) by.",
        "For example, if you\u2019re ranking farmers to see who produced the most corn\n(within their state), then you would use the bushels_produced column. For details,\nsee Examples (in this topic).",
        "Tie values result in the same rank value; however, gaps in the sequence result from the tie values.",
        "For example, if the first three rows return 1, RANK skips 2 and 3 and assigns 4 to the next row in the group.",
        "To avoid gaps, use the DENSE_RANK function instead.",
        "Create a table and data:",
        "Show farmers\u2019 corn production in descending order, along with the rank of each\nindividual farmer\u2019s production (highest = 1):",
        "Within each state, show farmers\u2019 corn production in descending order, along with the rank of each\nindividual farmer\u2019s production (highest = 1):",
        "The query and output below show how tie values are handled by the RANK and DENSE_RANK functions. Note that for DENSE_RANK,\nthe ranks are 1, 2, 3, 3, 4. Unlike with the output from the RANK function, the rank 4 is not skipped because there was a tie for rank 3.",
