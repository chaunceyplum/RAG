        "Lists all the roles which you can view across your entire account, including the system-defined roles and any custom roles that exist.",
        "Important",
        "Snowflake allows users to list roles; however, the ability to list roles is not the same as using any role. Knowing the names of\nroles does not allow any additional access.",
        "This is a part of Discretionary Access Control and Role-Based Access Control. For more information, see\nOverview of Access Control.",
        "SHOW GRANTS , CREATE ROLE ,  ALTER ROLE ,  DROP ROLE",
        "Returns only a subset of columns:",
        "Specifies whether the role used to run the command is the user\u2019s default role.",
        "Specifies whether the role used to run the command is the user\u2019s current role.",
        "Specifies whether the role used to run the command inherits the specified role.",
        "Optionally filters the command output by object name. The filter uses case-insensitive pattern matching, with support for SQL\nwildcard characters (% and _).",
        "For example, the following patterns return the same results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output).",
        "Returns records for the specified class (class_name).",
        "Optionally filters the command output based on the characters that appear at the beginning of\nthe object name. The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "For example, the following strings return different results:",
        ". Default: No value (no filtering is applied to the output)",
        "Optionally limits the maximum number of rows returned, while also enabling \u201cpagination\u201d of the results. The actual number of rows\nreturned might be less than the specified limit. For example, the number of existing objects is less than the specified limit.",
        "The optional FROM 'name_string' subclause effectively serves as a \u201ccursor\u201d for the results. This enables fetching the\nspecified number of rows following the first row whose object name matches the specified string:",
        "The string must be enclosed in single quotes and is case-sensitive.",
        "The string does not have to include the full object name; partial names are supported.",
        "Default: No value (no limit is applied to the output)",
        "Note",
        "For SHOW commands that support both the FROM 'name_string' and STARTS WITH 'name_string' clauses, you can combine\nboth of these clauses in the same statement. However, both conditions must be met or they cancel out each other and no results are\nreturned.",
        "In addition, objects are returned in lexicographic order by name, so FROM 'name_string' only returns rows with a higher\nlexicographic value than the rows returned by STARTS WITH 'name_string'.",
        "For example:",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'B' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'B' LIMIT ... FROM 'A' would return no results.",
        "... STARTS WITH 'A' LIMIT ... FROM 'AB' would return results (if any rows match the input strings).",
        "The command does not require a running warehouse to execute.",
        "To post-process the output of this command, you can use the RESULT_SCAN function, which treats the output as a table that can be queried.",
        "If you specify CLASS, only the following columns are returned:",
        "Show all roles:",
        "In this example:",
        "The ACCOUNTADMIN system-defined role is the current role and default role for the current (i.e. logged-in) user.",
        "In addition to the four system-defined roles, one custom role (ANALYST) has been created. The role is owned by the SECURITYADMIN\nsystem-defined role.",
