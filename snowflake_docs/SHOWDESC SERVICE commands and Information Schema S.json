        "This behavior change is in the 2024_06 bundle.",
        "For the current status of the bundle, refer to Bundle History.",
        "When this behavior change bundle is enabled, the output of the SHOW SERVICES and\nDESCRIBE SERVICE commands and the Information Schema\nSERVICES view include the following new columns:",
        "Column name",
        "Data type",
        "Description",
        "CURRENT_INSTANCES",
        "NUMBER",
        "The current number of instances for the service.",
        "TARGET_INSTANCES",
        "NUMBER",
        "The target number of service instances that should be running as determined by Snowflake.",
        "When the CURRENT_INSTANCES value is not equal to the TARGET_INSTANCES value, Snowflake is either in the process of shutting\ndown or launching service instances.",
        "For example,",
        "Suppose you create a service with MIN_INSTANCES = 1 and MAX_INSTANCES = 3. While the service is running, Snowflake might\ndetermine that one instance is not enough. In this case, the value of TARGET_INSTANCES will increase, indicating\nSnowflake is in the process of launching additional instances.",
        "It is also possible that the TARGET_INSTANCES value is less than the CURRENT_INSTANCES value, which indicates that\nSnowflake is in the process of reducing the number of running instances.",
        "If you create services but the compute pool does not have capacity for the minimum number of instances that you\nrequested, the value of  TARGET_INSTANCES will be equal to the value of MIN_INSTANCES. The value of CURRENT_INSTANCES\nwill be less than the value of TARGET_INSTANCES.",
        "SPEC_DIGEST",
        "VARCHAR",
        "The unique and immutable identifier representing the service spec content.",
        "To observe the changes to the value of the SPEC_DIGEST column over time, a service user might execute the SHOW SERVICES\ncommand periodically. If the service user notices a change in value, they can infer that the service was upgraded.",
        "IS_UPGRADING",
        "BOOLEAN",
        "TRUE, if Snowflake is in the process of upgrading the service.",
        "MANAGING_OBJECT_DOMAIN",
        "VARCHAR",
        "The domain of the managing object (for example, the domain of the notebook that manages the service). NULL if the service\nis not managed by a Snowflake entity.",
        "MANAGING_OBJECT_NAME",
        "VARCHAR",
        "The domain of the managing object (for example, the name of the notebook that manages the service). NULL if the service is\nnot managed by a Snowflake entity.",
        "Note",
        "The new CURRENT_INSTANCES and TARGET_INSTANCES columns appear after the existing DNS_NAME column.",
        "The new SPEC_DIGEST, IS_UPGRADING, MANAGING_OBJECT_DOMAIN, and MANAGING_OBJECT_NAME columns appear at the end.",
