        "All warehouse tasks can be performed from the Snowflake web interface or using the DDL commands for warehouses.",
        "You can create a warehouse by using the following interfaces:",
        "Select Admin \u00bb Warehouses \u00bb Warehouse",
        "Select Warehouses  \u00bb Create",
        "Execute a CREATE WAREHOUSE command.",
        "Use the WarehouseCollection.create\nAPI (Creating a warehouse).",
        "When you create a warehouse, you can specify whether the warehouse is created initially in the \u201cStarted\u201d (i.e. running) or \u201cSuspended\u201d\nstate. If you choose \u201cStarted\u201d, the warehouse starts consuming credits once all the compute resources are provisioned for the warehouse.",
        "Note",
        "If you choose to create a warehouse in the \u201cStarted\u201d state, the warehouse may take some time to become fully available as Snowflake\nprovisions all the compute resources for the warehouse.",
        "A warehouse can be started at any time, including on initial creation. Once a warehouse is created, resuming a warehouse is the same as\nstarting a warehouse.",
        "You can resume a suspended (that is, inactive) warehouse by using the following interfaces:",
        "Select Admin \u00bb Warehouses \u00bb <suspended_warehouse_name> \u00bb  \u00bb Resume",
        "Select Warehouses  \u00bb <suspended_warehouse_name> \u00bb Resume",
        "Execute an ALTER WAREHOUSE command with the RESUME keyword.",
        "Use the WarehouseResource.resume\nAPI (Performing warehouse operations).",
        "Starting a warehouse typically takes only a few seconds; however, in some rare instances, it can take longer as Snowflake provisions the\ncompute resources for the warehouse.",
        "Warehouses consume credits while running:",
        "A warehouse begins to consume credits once all the compute resources are provisioned for the warehouse.",
        "In a rare instance when some of the compute resources fail to provision, the warehouse only consumes credits for the provisioned\ncompute resources.",
        "Once the remaining compute resources are successfully provisioned, the warehouse starts consuming credits for all requested compute\nresources.",
        "While starting or resuming a warehouse often takes only a few seconds, in some instances, it can take longer as Snowflake provisions the\ncompute resources for the warehouse.",
        "Snowflake does not begin executing SQL statements submitted to a warehouse until all of the compute resources for the warehouse are\nsuccessfully provisioned, unless any of the resources fail to provision:",
        "If any of the compute resources for the warehouse fail to provision during start-up, Snowflake attempts to repair the failed resources.",
        "During the repair process, the warehouse starts processing SQL statements once 50% or more of the requested compute resources are\nsuccessfully provisioned.",
        "Credits are billed on a per-second basis while the warehouse is running, with a 1-minute minimum each time the warehouse is resumed; however,\ncredit consumption is reported in 60-minute (i.e. hourly) increments.",
        "Note",
        "A warehouse must be running and the current warehouse for the session (i.e. in use) to\nprocess SQL statements submitted in the session. For more information, refer to Using a Warehouse in this topic.",
        "A running warehouse can be suspended at any time, even while executing SQL statements. Suspending a warehouse stops the\nwarehouse from consuming credits once all the compute resources shut down.",
        "You can suspend a warehouse by using the following interfaces:",
        "Select Admin \u00bb Warehouses \u00bb <started_warehouse_name> \u00bb  \u00bb Suspend",
        "Select Warehouses  \u00bb <started_warehouse_name> \u00bb Suspend",
        "Execute an ALTER WAREHOUSE command with the SUSPEND keyword.",
        "Use the WarehouseResource.suspend\nAPI (Performing warehouse operations).",
        "When you suspend a warehouse, Snowflake immediately shuts down all idle compute resources for the warehouse, but allows any compute\nresources that are executing statements to continue until the statements complete, at which time the resources are shut down and the status\nof the warehouse changes to \u201cSuspended\u201d. Compute resources waiting to shut down are considered to be in \u201cquiesce\u201d mode.",
        "A warehouse can be resized up or down at any time, including while it is running and processing statements.",
        "You can resize a warehouse by using the following interfaces:",
        "Select Admin \u00bb Warehouses \u00bb <warehouse_name> \u00bb  \u00bb Edit",
        "Select Warehouses  \u00bb <warehouse_name> \u00bb Configure",
        "Execute an ALTER WAREHOUSE command with SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = ....",
        "Use the WarehouseResource.create_or_alter\nAPI (Creating or altering a warehouse).",
        "Resizing a warehouse to a larger size is useful when the operations being performed by the warehouse will benefit from more compute resources,\nincluding:",
        "Improving the performance of large, complex queries against large data sets.",
        "Improving performance while loading and unloading significant amounts of data.",
        "Resizing a running warehouse adds or removes compute resources in each cluster in the warehouse. All the usage and credit\nrules associated with starting or suspending a warehouse apply to resizing a started warehouse, such as:",
        "Compute resources added to a warehouse start using credits when they are provisioned; however, the additional compute resources don\u2019t\nstart executing statements until they are all provisioned, unless some of the resources fail to provision.",
        "Compute resources are removed from a warehouse only when they are no longer being used to execute any current statements.",
        "Resizing a warehouse doesn\u2019t have any impact on statements that are currently being executed by the warehouse. When resizing to a larger\nsize, the new compute resources, once fully provisioned, are used only to execute statements that are already in the warehouse queue, as\nwell as all future statements submitted to the warehouse.",
        "Tip",
        "To verify the additional compute resources for your warehouse have been fully provisioned, add the WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION parameter\nto the ALTER WAREHOUSE command. You can also use SHOW WAREHOUSES to check its\nstate.",
        "Resizing a suspended warehouse does not provision any new compute resources for the warehouse. It simply instructs Snowflake to provision\nthe additional compute resources when the warehouse is next resumed, at which time all the usage and credit rules associated with starting a\nwarehouse apply.",
        "To execute a query or DML statement in Snowflake, a warehouse must be running and it must be specified as the current warehouse for the\nsession in which the query/statement is submitted.",
        "A Snowflake session can only have one current warehouse at a time. The current warehouse for the session can be specified or changed at any\ntime through the USE WAREHOUSE SQL command or the WarehouseResource.use_warehouse Python API.",
        "Once a running warehouse has been set as the current warehouse for the session, queries and DML statements submitted within the session are\nprocessed by the warehouse. In the History  and Worksheets  pages in the Classic Console,\nyou can view the warehouse used to process each query/statement.",
        "Note",
        "Some Snowsight features require a warehouse to run SQL queries for retrieving data, such as Task Run History or\nData Preview for a table. An X-Small warehouse is recommended and generally sufficient for most of these queries. For information,\nsee Warehouse considerations.",
        "By default, the ACCOUNTADMIN role is granted the ability to alter, suspend, describe, and perform other operations on all\nwarehouses in the account.",
        "If you need to delegate these abilities to a custom role in your account, you can grant the MANAGE WAREHOUSES privilege to that role.\nGranting the MANAGE WAREHOUSES privilege is equivalent to granting the\nMODIFY, MONITOR, and OPERATE privileges on all warehouses in the account.",
        "The following examples demonstrate how you can delegate the ability to manage warehouses to a custom role named\nmanage_wh_role. The example uses the manage_wh_role to make changes to the warehouse test_wh, which is owned by a\ndifferent role (create_wh_role).",
        "Create a new role that will create and own a new warehouse, and grant the CREATE WAREHOUSE privilege to that role:",
        "Using the GRANT <privileges> command:",
        "Using the RoleResource.grant_privileges API:",
        "Create a second role that will manage all warehouses in the account, and grant the MANAGE WAREHOUSES privilege to that role:",
        "Using the create_wh_role role, create a new warehouse:",
        "Change the current role to manage_wh_role:",
        "Although the manage_wh_role does not own the test_wh, that role does have the MANAGE WAREHOUSES privilege, which means\nthat you can:",
        "Suspend and resume the warehouse:",
        "Change the size of the warehouse:",
        "Describe the warehouse:",
        "You must use the ACCOUNTADMIN role, or a role granted the relevant warehouse privileges.",
        "To review warehouses and manage warehouse details in Snowsight, complete the following steps:",
        "Sign in to Snowsight.",
        "Select Admin \u00bb Warehouses.",
        "You can then review the table of warehouses, search for warehouses, or filter the list of warehouses by status or size.",
        "By default, you can see the following information about each warehouse:",
        "Name",
