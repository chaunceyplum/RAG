        "This topic describes key features of Streamlit in Snowflake.",
        "Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create\nand share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. By using Streamlit you can quickly\nbuild and deploy powerful data applications. For more information about the open-source library, see the\nStreamlit Library documentation.",
        "Streamlit in Snowflake helps developers securely build, deploy, and share Streamlit apps on Snowflake\u2019s data\ncloud. Using Streamlit in Snowflake, you can build applications that process and use data in Snowflake without moving\ndata or application code to an external system.",
        "Snowflake manages the underlying compute and storage for Streamlit apps.",
        "Streamlit apps are Snowflake objects and use Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to manage access to Streamlit apps.",
        "Streamlit apps run on Snowflake warehouses and use internal stages to store files and data.",
        "Streamlit in Snowflake works seamlessly with Snowpark, user-defined functions (UDFs), stored procedures, and Snowflake Native App Framework.",
        "When working with Snowsight, you use the side-by-side editor and app preview screen to quickly add, adjust, or remove components. In this way, you can modify your code and see changes in the app right away.",
        "For additional use cases on building dashboards, data tools, and ML/AI, see Streamlit in Snowflake demos.",
        "Note",
        "These quickstarts are only shown as examples. Following along with the example may require additional rights to third-party data,\nproducts, or services that are not owned or provided by Snowflake. Snowflake does not guarantee the accuracy of these examples.",
        "Streamlit in Snowflake requires a virtual warehouse\nto run a Streamlit app and to perform SQL queries. To run a Streamlit app, you must select a single\nvirtual warehouse to run both the app itself and its queries. This warehouse remains active while the\napp\u2019s WebSocket connection is active. The WebSocket connection, which keeps the Streamlit app\u2019s\nvirtual warehouse active, expires approximately 15 minutes after the app\u2019s last use.",
        "To conserve credits, you can suspend the virtual warehouse. Alternatively, you can close the webpage running the app,\nwhich allows the virtual warehouse that is running to auto-suspend.",
