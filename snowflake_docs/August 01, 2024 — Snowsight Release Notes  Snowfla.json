        "With this release, we are pleased to announce the general availability of the new stage explorer in Snowsight. When you load a staged file into a table, you can select the files directly from a stage explorer. In the stage explorer, you can select the stage root, or folders and files within the stage. You don\u2019t need to navigate to the stage in the object explorer anymore, and you don\u2019t need to copy and paste the path of the staged file when loading a staged file into a table.",
