        "Creates a new Snowpark Container Services service\nin the current schema. If a service with that name already exists, use the DROP SERVICE command to delete the previously\ncreated service.",
        "You can run more than one instance of your service. Each service instance is a collection of containers, as defined in the\nservice specification file, that run together on a node in your compute pool. If you run multiple instances of a service, a load\nbalancer manages incoming traffic.",
        "Note that the command parameters must be specified in specific order. For more information, see the Usage Notes section.",
        "ALTER SERVICE , DESCRIBE SERVICE, DROP SERVICE , SHOW SERVICES",

        "String that specifies the identifier (that is, the name) for the service; it must be unique for the schema in which the service\nis created.",
        "Quoted names for special characters or case-sensitive names are not supported. The same constraint also applies to database\nand schema names where you create a service. That is, database and schema names without quotes are valid when creating a\nservice.",
        "Specifies the name of the compute pool in your account on which to run the service.",
        "Identifies the specification or\nthe template specification for the service.",
        "Using a service specification",
        "You can either define the specification either inline or in a separate file.",
        "Specifies the file containing the service specification or the service specification inline. If your service specification is in a file, use SPECIFICATION_FILE. For services created in a Snowflake Native App, omit @stage, and specify a path relative to the app root directory. For services created in other contexts, specify the Snowflake internal stage and path to the service specification file.",
        "Using a service specification template",
        "You can either define the template specification either inline or in a separate file.",
        "Specifies the file containing the service specification template or the service specification template inline. If your service specification template is in a file, use SPECIFICATION_TEMPLATE_FILE. For services created in a Snowflake Native App, omit @stage, and specify a path relative to the app root directory. For services created in other contexts, specify the Snowflake internal stage and path to the service specification file. When using template specification, you should also include the USING parameter.",
        "Specifies the template variables and the values of those variables.",
        "key is the name of the template variable. The template variable name can optionally be enclosed in double quotes\n(\").",
        "value is the value to assign to the variable in the template. String values must be enclosed in ' or\n$$. The value must either be alphanumeric or valid JSON.",
        "Use a comma between each key-value pair.",
        "Specifies the names of the external access integrations that allow your service to access external sites.\nThe names in this list are case-sensitive. By default, application containers don\u2019t have\npermission to access the internet. If you want to allow your service to access an external site, create an External Access Integration\n(EAI), and configure your service to use that integration. For more\ninformation, see Configuring network egress.",
        "Specifies whether to automatically resume a service when user performs one of the following actions that depend on the service:",

        "If AUTO_RESUME is FALSE, you need to explicitly resume the service (using ALTER SERVICE \u2026 RESUME).",
        "Specifies the minimum number of service instances to run.",
        "Default: 1.",
        "Indicates the minimum service instances that must be ready for Snowflake to consider the service is ready to process requests.\nMIN_READY_INSTANCES must be equal to or less than MIN_INSTANCES. For more information, see Scaling services.",
        "Note",
        "After you create a service, if you want to use the SHOW SERVICES or DESCRIBE SERVICE command to find the MIN_READY_INSTANCES configured for the service, you must enable the 2024_08 behavior change bundle in your account.\nTo enable this bundle in your account, execute the following statement:",
        "Default: The value of the MIN_INSTANCES property.",
        "Specifies the maximum number of service instances to run.",
        "Default: The value of the MIN_INSTANCES property.",
        "Warehouse to use if a service container connects to Snowflake to execute a query but does not explicitly specify a warehouse\nto use.",
        "Default: none.",
        "Specifies the tag name and the tag string value.",
        "The tag value is always a string, and the maximum number of characters for the tag value is 256.",
        "For information about specifying tags in a statement, see Tag quotas for objects and columns.",
        "Specifies a comment for the service.",

        "Regarding metadata:",
