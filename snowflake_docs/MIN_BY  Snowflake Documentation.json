        "Finds the row(s) containing the minimum value for a column and returns the value of another column in that row.",
        "For example, if a table contains the columns employee_id and salary, MIN_BY(employee_id, salary) returns the value\nof the employee_id column for the row that has the lowest value in the salary column.",
        "If multiple rows contain the specified minimum value, the function is non-deterministic.",
        "To return values for multiple rows, specify the optional maximum_number_of_values_to_return argument. With this\nadditional argument:",
        "The function returns an ARRAY containing the values of a column for the rows with the lowest\nvalues of a specified column.",
        "The values in the ARRAY are sorted by their corresponding values in the column containing the minimum values.",
        "If multiple rows contain these lowest values, the function is non-deterministic.",
        "For example, MIN_BY(employee_id, salary, 5) returns an ARRAY of values of the employee_id column for the five rows\ncontaining the lowest values in the salary column. The IDs in the ARRAY are sorted by the corresponding values in the\nsalary column.",

        "Constant integer specifying the maximum number of values to return. You must specify a positive number. The maximum number that\nyou can specify is 1000.",
        "If maximum_number_of_values_to_return is not specified, the function returns a value of the same type as\ncol_to_return.",
        "If maximum_number_of_values_to_return is specified, the function returns an ARRAY containing values of the same type\nas col_to_return. The values in the ARRAY are sorted by their corresponding col_containing_mininum values.",
        "For example, MIN_BY(employee_id, salary, 5) returns the IDs of the employees with the lowest five salaries, sorted by\nsalary (in ascending order).",
        "The function ignores NULL values in col_containing_mininum.",
        "If all values in col_containing_mininum are NULL, the function returns NULL (regardless of whether the optional\nmaximum_number_of_values_to_return argument is specified).",
        "The following examples demonstrate how to use the MIN_BY function.",
        "To run these examples, execute the following statements to set up the table and data for the examples:",
        "Execute the following statement to view the contents of this table:",
        "The following example returns the ID of the employee with the lowest salary:",
        "Note the following:",
        "Because more than one row contains the minimum value for the salary column, the function is non-deterministic and might\nreturn the employee ID for a different row in subsequent executions.",
        "The function ignores the NULL value in the salary column when determining the rows with the minimum values.",
        "The following example returns an ARRAY containing the IDs of the employees with the three lowest salaries:",
        "As shown in the example, the values in the ARRAY are sorted by their corresponding values in the salary column. So,\nMIN_BY returns the IDs of employees sorted by their salary in ascending order.",
        "If more than one of these rows contain the same value in the salary column, the order of the returned values for that salary\nis non-deterministic.",
