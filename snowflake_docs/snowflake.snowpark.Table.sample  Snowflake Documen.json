Similar to flipping a weighted coin for each row.\n- \u201cSYSTEM\u201d (or \u201cBLOCK\u201d): Includes each block of rows with a probability of p/100. Similar to flipping a weighted coin for each block of rows. This method does not support fixed-size sampling.\nDefault is None. Then the Snowflake database will use \u201cROW\u201d by default.",
