        "The column to partition on, if you want the result to be split into multiple\nwindows.",

        "Returns the total number of records.",
        "When you pass a wildcard to the function, you can qualify the wildcard with the name or alias for the table.\nFor example, to pass in all of the columns from the table named mytable, specify the following:",
        "You can also use the ILIKE and EXCLUDE keywords for filtering:",
        "ILIKE filters for column names that match the specified pattern. Only one\npattern is allowed. For example:",
        "EXCLUDE filters out column names that don\u2019t match the specified column or columns. For example:",
        "Qualifiers are valid when you use these keywords. The following example uses the ILIKE keyword to\nfilter for all of the columns that match the pattern col1% in the table mytable:",
        "The ILIKE and EXCLUDE keywords can\u2019t be combined in a single function call.",
        "If you specify an unqualified and unfiltered wildcard (*), the function returns the total number of records, including\nrecords with NULL values.",
        "If you specify a wildcard with the ILIKE or EXCLUDE keyword for filtering, the function excludes records with NULL values.",
        "For this function, the ILIKE and EXCLUDE keywords are valid only in a SELECT list or GROUP BY clause.",

        "Returns the number of records that don\u2019t contain any NULL values. For an example, see Examples.",
        "Returns a value of type NUMBER.",

        "When this function is called as an aggregate function:",
        "If the DISTINCT keyword is used, it applies to all columns. For example,\nDISTINCT col1, col2, col3 means to return the number of different\ncombinations of columns col1, col2, and col3. For example, assume the data is:",
        "In this case, the function returns 2, because that\u2019s the number of distinct combinations of values in the three columns.",
        "When this function is called as a window function with an OVER clause that contains an ORDER BY clause:",
        "A window frame is required. If no window frame is specified explicitly, the following implied window frame is used:",

        "Using the keyword DISTINCT inside the window function is prohibited and results in a compile-time error.",
        "To return the number of rows that match a condition, use COUNT_IF.",
        "When possible, use the COUNT function on tables and views without a row access policy.\nThe query with this function is faster and more accurate on tables or views without a row access policy. The reasons for the performance\ndifference include:",
        "Snowflake maintains statistics on tables and views, and this optimization allows simple queries to run faster.",
        "When a row access policy is set on a table or view and the COUNT function is used in a query, Snowflake must scan each row and\ndetermine whether the user is allowed to view the row.",
        "The following examples use the COUNT function on data with NULL values.",
        "Create a table and insert values:",
        "Query the table:",
        "The All column in this output shows that when an unqualified and unfiltered wildcard is specified\nfor COUNT, the function returns the total number of rows in the table, including rows with NULL values. The other\ncolumns in the output show that when a column or a wildcard with filtering is specified, the function excludes\nrows with NULL values.",
        "The next query uses the COUNT function with the GROUP BY clause:",
        "The following example shows that COUNT(alias.*) returns the number of rows that don\u2019t contain any NULL values.\nThe basic_example table has a total of six rows, but three rows have at least one NULL value, and the other three rows\nhave no NULL values.",
        "The following example shows that JSON null (VARIANT NULL) is treated as SQL NULL by\nthe COUNT function.",

        "In this SQL code, note the following:",
        "The first INSERT INTO statement inserts a SQL NULL for both a VARIANT column and a non-VARIANT column.",
        "The second INSERT INTO statement inserts a JSON null (VARIANT NULL).",
